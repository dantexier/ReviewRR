"Altenhoner R.","Data for the future The German project ""Co-operative development of a long-term digital information archive"" (kopal)",2006,"Library Hi Tech",24,4,,574,582,,1,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33751414796&partnerID=40&md5=bd71b2466ed6f2c4a795f31b237d722f","Purpose - One of the unresolved problems of the global information society is ensuring the long-term accessibility of digital documents. The project kopal tackles this problem head-on: in a three-year project kopal's objective is the practical testing and implementation of a cooperatively created and operated long-term archival system for digital resources. Design/methodology/approach - The system will be implementedin accordance with international standards for long-term archiving and metadata within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) framework. The project partners, Die Deutsche Bibliothek (DDB), Göttingen State and University Library (SUB Göttingen), IBM Deutschland GmbH and the Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG), will establish a cooperatively transferable solution for cultural heritage institutions, as well as for business and industry. Findings - Within the project, the project partners DDB and SUB Göttingen are developing software for the input and access of data, which will be released under an open-source license. Research limitations/implications - Long-term preservation methods and strategies will be discussed in general in the paper. Practical implications - The project will present a stable and reusable platform for additional partners and users, especially for cultural heritage organisations. Originality/value - The solution is based on Digital Information and Archiving System (DIAS), jointly devised by IBM and the National Library of The Netherlands in The Hague, and it will be adapted to the needs of the project with several extensions. Establishing a collaborative solution for long-term preservation is a milestone in the development of systems for the long-term availability of digital objects.","Archives management; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Germany",,"Neubauer, M., Wollschläger, T., ""Maschinelle Gewinnung technischer Metadaten für die Langzeitarchivierung elektronischer Publikationen"" (2006) B.I.T.

If there is a way to integrate this data, it would enhance the chemist's knowledge about a given compound. The Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) specification may provide a solution to this problem. ORE is a model proposed by the digital libraries community to aggregate resources on the web. OREChem is a research project funded by Microsoft External Research that aims to apply and extend ORE to enable the integration of experimental, bibliographical and molecular properties data. OREChem targets crystallography as its primary application domain. This effort will design a prototypical, semantic-based eScience infrastructure for chemistry and chemical informatics. In this paper we describe how we have used REST as well as SOAP web services, TeraGrid cyberinfrastructure and Semantic Web technologies, such as RDF and triple stores, to facilitate the metadata integration.","Information storage and retrieval; Online information services - web-based services; REST services; Rule-based databases","Aggregate resources; Application domains; Chemical informatics; Cyber infrastructures; e-Science; Information storage and retrieval; Metadata integration; MicroSoft; Molecular properties; Object reuse; Online information services; REST services; Rule-based database; Semantic Web technology; TeraGrid; Triple store; Web architecture; Crystallography; Data fusion; Digital libraries; Grid computing; Information retrieval; Information services; Integration; Metadata; Research; Semantic Web; Semantics; Web services","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TriplestoreMcBride, B., (2004), http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer, Feb 10Lagoze, C.V., (2008) ORE User Guide, , http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/primer; Bizer, C., Cyganiak, R., Heath, T., (2007) How to Publish Linked Data on the Web, , http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial, Jul 27; http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/Lagoze, C.V., (2008) ORE User Guide - Resource Map Implementation in Atom, , http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/atom, Oct; Microsoft Research OREChem Project, , http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/orechem/; http://chemxseer.ist.psu.edu/http://ecrystals.chem.soton.ac.uk/http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/IUCr's CIF Files, , http://www.iucr.org/resources/cif; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Markup_Languagehttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htmhttps://jersey.dev.java.net/nonav/documentation/latest/user-guide.htmlhttp://www.json.org/fatfree.htmlhttp://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/inchifaq/http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_PageDay, N., Crystal Eye Harvester Bit Bucket Page, , http://bitbucket.org/ned24/crystaleye-harvesters/src/; Rust, P.M., http://bitbucket.org/gigadot/semantic-compchem/Young, D., The Absolute Beginners Guide to Gaussian, , http://www.ccl.net/cca/documents/dyoung/topicsorig/gaussian.html, Retrieved from; http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/usingxsl/commandline.htmlhttp://www.w3.org/TR/grddl-primer/http://jackrabbit.apache.org/, [Online]https://orechem.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/orechemErling, O., Implementing A SPARQL Compliant RDF Triplestore Using SQL-ORDBMS, , http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/dav/wiki/Main/VOSRDFWP; SPARQL: Query Language for RDF, , http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/; http://www.w3.org/International/O-URL-andident.htmlOGCE Workflow Suite, , http://www.collabogce.org/ogce/index.php/Workflow; https://www.teragrid.org/web/user-support/compute_resources?p_p_id= hardwareresources_WAR_userinfoportlet_INSTANCE_v9AO&p_p_lifecycle= 1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column- 1&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=4&_hardwareresources_WAR_userinfoportlet_INSTANCE_v9AO_id=50, Abe NCSA [Online]SPARQL Endpoint, , http://gf18.ucs.indiana.edu8890/sparql, [Online]; http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/, [Online]",Conference Paper,Scopus
