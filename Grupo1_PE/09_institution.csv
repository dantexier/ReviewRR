"Saiso E.P.","Finding support for disruption: Developing a digital humanities project in Mexico",2012,"Aslib Proceedings: New Information Perspectives",64,1,,97,103,,,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84855774471&partnerID=40&md5=886813dac0e64b81c3615aaecb428cda","Purpose: This paper seeks to provide a description and reflection on some of the structural problems and challenges faced when developing a digital humanities (DH) project in a Mexican public university. Design/methodology/approach: As DH is a relatively new field and practice in Mexican academia, this article is based on a case study of developing the Biblioteca Digital de Pensamiento Novohispano (Digital Library of New Hispanic Thought). This is one of the few DH at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), the largest public university in the country. Findings: It was found that there were three central problems for developing a DH project in a Mexican public university: existing technical knowledge and abilities at the UNAM will be challenged by DH projects; projects are the place to train human resources in DH methodology; and researchers need to consider different long-term infrastructure and hosting solutions, with or without using institutional infrastructure, at the same time researches need to work within the institution to establish a specific policy for research projects. Practical implications: The paper concludes that the structure, goals and products of DH projects need to be modified and expanded in order to also consider alternative goals and products such as: proposals of institutional policy, creation of infrastructure and academic and student training. DH projects must be regarded as disruptive, that is that the project needs to assume rupture as a part of the project itself. Originality/value: The experience of innovation and disruption is not necessarily the same in all fields and all institutions. This article documents for the first time the particular experiences of a public university in a developing country with DH projects. It has been found that the delay in using computers in the humanities in Mexico has led to the development of a specific paradox: a gap between institutional interest and disposition in the use of computers in humanities, and the lack of DH culture in those who have to develop the project. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital humanities; Digital libraries; Institutional support; Library projects; Mexico; Public university; Scholarly editing","Digital humanities; Institutional support; Me-xico; Public universities; Scholarly editing; Developing countries; Research; Societies and institutions; Digital libraries","Gayosso, B., Cómo se conectó México a Internet (2003) Revista Digital Universitaria, 5 (5). , 1 October; Hockey, S., The history of humanities computing (2004) A Companion to Digital Humanities, , www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/, available at (accessed 2 April 2010), Schreibman, S., Siemens, R., Unsworth, J.

In digital archives, there's a high correlation between documental connotation and information techniques, especially in historically cultural information. Numerous institutions archives are going digitalized. People are able to access digital archives information, even if seldom people could access the original. However, on the current artificial intelligence methodology, it is still a hard problem to describe a story for humans after computer reading mass information. At this moment, if we can gather a lot of friends from the internet, discussing valuable photos, articles or videos from blogs, such as food and beverage blog, then, it would form a popular approach to set up a metadata. This paper offers this new concept to illustrate the new ideas, hoping that it can reduce the gap between current techniques and a willingness to create new ones. It also could create new meanings of knowledge management and cultural development.","Digital archive; Digital library; Food and Beverage Blog; Metadata",,"Han, B.D., (2000) Theory and practice of display planning, , Farm City Cultural press;

Design/methodology/approach: The 40 individuals working in the regional branch libraries of IAU were surveyed by a questionnaire consisting of 34 questions, and the collected data were analysed using SPSS software (version 16). Findings: It was found that the most important difficulties are the lack of suitable equipment and untrained personnel (i.e. a lack of sufficient training programmes). Research limitations/implications: Because of the small number of participants, it is suggested that a larger scale study is carried out. It is also proposed that the suggestions made by the participants will be considered and implemented, based on the digital library (DL) developments in academic libraries in different countries. Practical implications: It is expected that with improved library management, and the solving of the problems highlighted, through suitable training programmes, librarians will contribute more actively and effectively in establishing and managing DLs in the surveyed libraries. Originality/value: This research can contribute to existing knowledge in the areas of information technology and digital library management, especially in academic arenas.

Academic libraries are becoming very involved in managing electronic scholarly products and participating in the evolving scholarly communication process through institutional repositories. Although institutional repositories can make room for easier access to universities' research output, unfortunately it is not fully developed in some academic institutions. The origin of this problem is that there are known instances where librarians in-charge of institutional repository are unaware of their roles, and are unskilled in implementing the institutional repository. This paper describes a study conducted on the roles of librarians in the deployment and content recruitment of institutional repositories in eight (8) universities in Malaysia. Sample for this study are librarians who are involved with the development and implementation of institutional repository in their respective universities. The study reveals that the act of collecting materials for depositing is mainly done by librarians rather than the authors and researchers. Providing training sessions, holding meetings in departments and faculties, and also linking of the institutional repository website from the university and faculties' website have the highest rank in librarians' approach to promote the institutional repository. The paper also discusses the process of depositing, motivation factors, roles, marketing and benefits of institutional repository that will have reference value for the librarians who desire to embark on an institutional repository.","Academic libraries; Digital libraries; Institutional repositories; Malaysia; Open access initiatives; Roles of librarians",,"Abrizah, A., Piloting an institutional repository at a research-intensive university: Strategies for content recruitment and the role of the library (2010) World Digital Libraries, 3 (1), pp. 23-29; Abrizah, A., Kiran, K., Edzan, N.N., Zainab, A.N., Making Malaysian research available through publishing in Open Access E-journals and E-prints (2007) Persidangan Kebangsaan Ilmiah MAPIM, pp. 9-11; Allard, S., Mack, T.R., Feltner-Reichert, M., The librarian's role in institutional repositories (2005) Reference Services Review, 33 (3), pp. 325-336; Bailey, C.W., (2005) Open access bibliography: Liberating scholarly literature with e-prints and open access journals, , Association of Research Libraries Washington, DC; Barton, M., Murray, A., Holley, R., Planning for institutional repositories in the United Kingdom (2003) SCONUL Newsletter, 29, pp. 56-58; Bell, S., Institutional repositories: What will it take to fill them?

Often called ""closed labs"", formal laboratory sessions promote active learning, engage students in the material at hand, provide practice in problem solving, refine technical skills, and allow instructors to work individually with students to answer questions and facilitate learning. These lab sessions also can encourage pair programming and other collaborative activities - at least from time to time. Altogether, the advantages of closed labs are well documented; at least eighty-nine articles, published between 2010 and 1994, are indexed under ""closed labs"" in the ACM Digital Library. Also, different institutions have varying goals and priorities for their labs; and over the years various schools have developed guidelines and plans for their laboratory facilities (e.g., [1, 3, 4]). © 2010 ACM.","CS education research; Lab configurations; Pedagogy; Teaching labs","Active Learning; Collaborative activities; CS education research; Lab configurations; Laboratory exercise; Laboratory facilities; Laboratory sessions; Pair-programming; Pedagogy; Technical skills; Digital libraries; Students; Teaching; Laboratories","Computing at Cornell: Computers and Labs: Recommended Room Layout Guidelines, , http://www2.cit.cornell.edu/computer/instruct/classtech/labguide/ labguide.html, Computer Technologies Group of Cornell Information Technologies, modified 11 February 1999, accessed 11 June 2010, at; Denk, J., Laurie, F., The evolution of learning spaces (2008) Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Conference on User Services Conference, pp. 199-292. , October; Computer Lab Design Considerations, , http:www.colorado.edu/its/recomendations/labs.html, Information Technology Services of the University of Colorado at Boulder, reviewed 5 May 2009, accessed 11 June 2010 at; Young, A., Glenn, H., Designing new computer laboratories: Fresh ideas and new layouts (2003) Proceedings of the 16th Annual NACCQ, pp. 463-466. , July, Palmerston, New Zealand",Article,Scopus

Video recordings of the parliamentary sessions have also been integrated with their corresponding textual transcriptions. Design/methodology/approach: After analysing the state of the Andalusian Parliament's digital library and determining the aspects that could be improved both in the repository and access mechanisms, this paper describes each component of the developed integrated information system. Findings: A methodology has been developed to tackle the problem and this could be applied to other similar institutions and organisations. Exploiting the internal structure of the parliament's official documents has also proved to be extremely interesting for users as they are directed towards the most relevant parts of the documents.

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of digitisation surveys were performed. Analysis concentrated on several themes: general methodological solutions, digitisation objectives, users and usage of digitised content, budgeting and costs of digitisation, and volume and growth of digitised collections. Findings: Analysis revealed an absence of sound methodology solutions, issues of constructing a sample, the split between strategic and resource management approaches to digitisation, low visibility of user related evaluation criteria, and problems in developing quantitative measures. Research limitations/implications: Approaches to evaluating digitisation are not restricted to digitisation surveys and to provide a more comprehensive analysis these should be complemented by other data (e.g. interviews of digitisation experts). The identification of surveys was limited by subjective factors such as knowledge of national experts, visibility of reports on the web, and language of publication. Practical implications: The paper assists in the development of digitisation surveys by highlighting previous gaps and achievements. Originality/value: The paper is a first attempt to comprehend approaches to monitoring digitisation internationally. Gaps and issues identified in the research can guide studies on developing indicators and measures for specific digitisation activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Europe; European Union; Resource management",,"(2004) A Guide to European Group on Museum Statistics, , www.smb.spk-berlin.de/ifm/dokumente/materialien/IfM_001-202_WEB.pdf, European Group on Museum Statistics, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); (2003) ASERL Survey of Member Digitization Activities/Collections, , www.aserl.org/projects/digitization/ASERL_Digitization_Survey-Digitization_Mgrs.pdf, ASERL, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); Astle, P.J., Muir, A., Digitization and preservation in public libraries and archives (2002) Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 34 (2), pp. 67-79; Bazerman, C., Prior, P., (2004) What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Text and Textual Practices, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ and London; Besser, H., Digital image distribution: A study of costs and uses (1999) D-Lib Magazine, 5 (10). , www.dlib.org/dlib/october99/10besser.html, available at, (accessed 26 June 2008); Besser, H., (2003) Introduction to Imaging: Revised Version, , www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/introimages/, available at, (accessed 1 October 2008); Buckland, M., Information as thing (1991) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 42 (5), pp. 351-60; Bultmann, B., Hardy, R., Muir, A., Wictor, C., (2005) Digitised Content in the UK Research Library and Archives Sector, , www.jisc.ac.uk/uploaded_documents/JISC-Digi-in-UK-FULL-v1-final.pdf, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); (2008) Canadian Heritage Information Network, , www.chin.gc.ca/English/index.html, Canadian Heritage Information Network, available at, (accessed 1 October 2008); Cathro, W., Digitization in Australasia (2007) The Journal for the Serials Community, 20 (1), pp. 9-15; (2005) I2010: Digital Libraries, , http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/communication/en_comm_digital_libraries.pdf, Commission of the European Communities, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Commission of The European Communities, Belgium, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); (2003) Moving Theory into Practice: Digital Imaging Tutorial, , www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/tutorial/contents.html, Cornell, available at:, (accessed 1 October 2008); Coyle, K., Mass digitization of books (2006) The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 32 (6), pp. 641-5; Learning objects from cultural and scientific heritage resources (2003) DigiCULT, , www.digicult.info/downloads/digicult_thematicissue4_hres.pdf, DigiCULT, No. 4, available, (accessed 1 October 2008); Virtual communities and collaboration in the heritage sector (2004) DigiCULT, , www.digicult.info/downloads/digicult_thematicissue5_january_2004.pdf, DigiCULT, No. 5, available at:, (accessed 1 October 2008); (2008) Digital Libraries Initiative: Cultural Heritage, , http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/cultural/index_en.htm, Digital Libraries Initiative, available at:, (accessed 1 October 2008); (2006) DLF-Aquifer Services Institutional Survey Report: Aquifer Services Working Group Report on the Institutional User-Services Survey Results, , www.diglib.org/aquifer/SWGisrfinal.pdf, DLF-Aquifer Services, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); Dorner, D.D., Chawner, B., Searle, S., (2002) Creating a Digital Babylon?

All aspects of digital project management are discussed, including selection, infrastructure, budgeting, workflow and delivery. Design/methodology/approach - Experiences from project administration, including management of a combination in-house and outsourced digitization and metadata are discussed. Formation and management of the resulting web resource is explained, which is the product of a creative amalgamation of commercial and open source software. Challenges encountered are presented with suggestions for practical solutions and considerations for future projects. Findings - This grant-funded pilot project presented foreseen and unforeseen problems. Lessons learned and solutions suggesting best approaches for a small-scale digitization project are presented here. Practical implications - In this paper best practices and suggestions for managing a small digital project are presented, including financial, staffing and technical considerations. Originality/value - Unlike many other discussions that focus on management of large institutional projects, this study presents an incremental approach for small-scale digitization projects.

Design/methodology/approach - The author began researching metadata use in Thailand in 2003 and 2004 while on sabbatical from the University of Vermont. A small number of government libraries were in the process of building up their digital databases. These were identified from a survey conducted by the author at that time. The author continues to monitor the development of digital initiatives and has identified several new digital initiatives created by academic institutions since then. The digital initiatives operated by Thai government agencies and academic institutions that existed in 2007 are presented, along with one example of a metadata record randomly selected from each of these projects. These examples illustrate Dublin Core metadata use and cataloguing practice employed in these digital databases. The author's current research on the development of digital initiatives is included. Findings - This paper presents what the author feels are some significant technical and legal issues facing Thai digital initiatives. A major copyright issue in Thailand, the ineffective enforcement of intellectual property laws relating to access rights, is presented. Also discussed is the significant obstacle to record retrieval created by the structure and complexity of the Thai language. Originality/value - This paper identifies important issues and problems related to Thai digital initiatives and offers suggestions and comments aimed at enhancing the development and progress of digital initiatives both in the Thai library community and internationally. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cataloguing; Data collection; Digital libraries; Libraries; Thailand",,"Beall, J., (2005) Metadata and Data Quality Problems in the Digital Library, , http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/jodi-171/68, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Centre, Denver; Siripan, P., Creating vocabulary for Thai database integration (2005) DC-2005, International Conference on Dublin Core metadata and applications, , paper presented, Madrid, September 12-15, 2005, available at: http://dublin.tiac.or.th/doc/DC2005-Thailand.pdf; Tiac, (2006) Annual Reports, , www.tiac.or.th/about%20tiac1report.html, Technical Information Access Center, Prathumthani; Gorman, G.E., Cullen, R., The knowledge model applied to library networks in Asia (2000) Library Consortium Management: An International Journal, 2 (7), pp. 135-44; Siripan, P., Metadata and trends of cataloging in Thailand (1999) 65th IFLA Council and General Conference, , paper presented, August 20-28, 1999, Bangkok, available at: www.ifla.org/IV/ifla65/papers/114-131e.htm",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/ approach - This study selects six digital libraries to represent a variety of digital libraries developed or sponsored by different types of organisations. The Help features of these selected digital libraries are examined by their types (explicit versus implicit), formats (texts, images, screenshots, multimedia materials, and interactive formats), and presentation styles (descriptive, guided, procedural, and exemplary). Findings - This study presents the types of Help features available in the selected digital libraries, and further characterises the formats and presentation styles of these Help features. In the process of analysis, the author also identifies six types of problems: lack of standards; tradeoff between using explicit Help and implicit help; tradeoff between using general Help versus specific Help; lack of interactive Help features; lack of dynamic presentation styles; and lack of Help features for advanced users and users who do not understand English. Research limitations/implications - In order to design Help features that facilitate users to effectively use digital libraries, further research needs to extend studies to what types of help-seeking situations users generally encounter and the corresponding support they need.

Design/methodology/approach - Provides a description of an academic digital library's evolution into an institutional repository, accompanied by both practical and philosophical analyses. Findings - Materials supporting an academic institution's scholarship (from colleges and from supporting organizations on campus) can play an important part in the success of an institutional repository. Standards for metadata content, data structures and hierarchies of collections must be followed consistently, and adequate storage for digital media within an institutional repository is necessary to have in advance of anticipated demand for the smooth operation of the IR and continued access to materials. Gray areas between the role of an institutional repository and the role of that organization's archives need to be addressed in the future. Practical implications - Academic libraries can be highly successful in producing an institute repository by developing relationships with various organizations on campus in addition to the academic programs. Maintaining standards throughout the IR is crucial to future growth in an organized and consistent manner. Philosophical considerations of the role of the IR should be addressed in the beginning stages of the development of the IR for eliminating confusion and duplication of its contents with other campus organizations. Originality/value - This paper describes the development of a digital library, created and maintained by an academic library, and its gradual change into a de facto institutional repository. Other libraries in the planning stages or initial steps of creating a campus-wide digital library or an institutional repository can benefit from the description of possible successes and problems that they could encounter during implementation.","Archives management; Digital libraries",,"Buehler, M.A., Boateng, A., ""The evolving impact of institutional repositories on reference librarians"" (2005) Reference Services Review, 33 (3), p. 291; Cervone, H.F., ""The repository adventure"" (2004) Library Journal, 129 (10), pp. 44-46; Hayes, H., (2005) ""Digital Repositories, Helping Universities and Colleges"", , JISC briefing paper, August, Scotland; Pearce-Moses, R., (2005) A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology, , The Society of American Archivists Chicago, IL",Review,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - The paper first analyzes the definition and features of the digital library, and is followed by an introduction to the development of VRS in China. Through literature search and checking web sites, some 400 documents in CNKI have been analysed on VRS from the period of January, 1990 to June, 2005, and the situation in developing VRS and problems existing in the course of doing it in China have been summarized. On the basis of connecting theory and practice on VRS, the paper provides general tactics on how to develop VRS for libraries in China. Findings - There are some problems existing for China to develop VRS, namely shortage of funds, the information poor, the digital divide, restrictions of information infrastructure, library management, shortage of technical knowledge and user training. The paper projects what may be needed for China to continue its development of VRS in the future. There is a need for appropriate infrastructures, strategies and mechanisms to be established in order to support the diffusion of VRS principles throughout China. Originality/value - This paper provides some observations and insights on the design and development of VRS in China. It suggests that decision makers in government agencies need to understand the existing gaps in VRS in China. Constructive suggestions are made for China to construct VRS and improve the service level.","China; Information services","Digital libraries; Information retrieval; Information technology; Societies and institutions; World Wide Web; Information infrastructure; Information poor; Library management; Virtual reference services; Information services","Courtright, C., ""Health information-seeking among Latino newcomers: An exploratory study"" (2005) Information Research, 10 (2). , http://informationr.net/ir/10-2/paper224.html, available at:; Ge, S., ""Information and communication technologies for development"" (2003) 58th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, , www.cistc.gov.cn/embassymember/browse.asp?id=56016&site= 5461&column=5472, presented at the December 3, 2003. available at:; Jin, Y., Huang, M., Lin, H., Guo, J., ""Towards collaboration: The development of collaborative virtual reference service in China"" (2005) The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 31 (3), pp. 287-291; Li, J., ""Public library shows great concern for information access by the disadvantaged population"" (2005) Journal of Library and Information Sciences in Agriculture, (9), pp. 42-44; Lin, X., Zhang, Y., ""A comparative study of traditional reference services and network reference services"" (2003) Journal of Library Science in China, (6), pp. 44-47; Liu, Z., Li, W., On development of the spirit of public libraries in the digital age (2004) Library Issue, 4, pp. 2-5; Su, H.C., ""Collaboration is the social system of digital reference services"" (2003), http://210.34.4.20/society/jqli/society/paper/2003meeting/shchz.htm, available at:Wang, Z., Xiao, X., ""Library system innovation for knowledge aids to vulnerable groups"" (2005) Knowledge of Library and Information Science, (1), pp. 6-12; Xu, G., ""The construction of library core competence: Integration based on management science"" (2005) Journal of Library Science in China, (1), pp. 26-29; Yan, K., The study of the construction of digital expert reference of Northeast Normal University Library (2005)Yang, G., The development of the China digital library (2002) Electronic Journal of Academic and Special Librarianship, , http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/201/300/ejasl/2002/v03n03/content/v03n03/ Yang_g01.htm; Yuan, L., Xu, J., On the characteristics and trends of real-time query-answering services (2004) Journal of Library Science in China, 4, pp. 42-44; Zang, G., A theoretical thinking of real-time virtual reference service (2005) Journal of Library Science in China, (3), pp. 24-29; Zhai, J., Problems of virtual reference service in Chinese public libraries and their countermeasures in the New Century (2005) Library Issue, 3, pp. 25-28",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - Different categories of digital collections based on guidelines defined by the authors are presented. Issues related to public access are illustrated. A model using the FRBR entities relationships is proposed to improve the accessibility of digital cultural materials so that scholarly research can be enhanced. The number of digital collections has been increased significantly since the late 1990s, but few studies investigated how these collections were organized and managed. To attain an understanding of the current status of institutional digital collections, various collection sites were examined and analyzed. The study focused on the existence and level of richness of bibliographic descriptions provided for each image; whether a search engine was available or not; how easily the search could be performed; and how search results were organized. The presentation of search results is problematic. Applying the IFLA FRBR model to digital materials can bring a solution. Findings - The IFLA FRBR model presents the search results hierarchically so that related materials can be easily collocated. This feature meets the end-users needs. The attributes of work and expression entities presented in the IFLA FRBR model should be applied differently for event-based digital cultural materials. Defining work- or expression-level entities under the event or theme will be more logical than under author and/or title for cultural materials. Doing expression-level cataloging might also work for this type of materials. Originality/value - Before building a digital collection, institutions should have a well-thought-out and well-planned collection management mechanism. Metadata scheme, content standards and content management system are important fundamentals. Much can be done to improve the accessibility of digital collections. The proposed FRBRized approach will make the retrieval of digital cultural objects easier.","Cataloguing; Content management; Digital libraries; Search engines",,"Besser, H., ""Image databases: The first decade, the present, and the future"" (1997) Digital Image Access and Retrieval, pp. 11-28. , Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Heidorn, P.B.

The information gathered was supplemented by data obtained from the transaction logs. Findings - The results have revealed the use made of the OPAC and the characteristics of the searches performed. Users are still confronted by classic problems of information seeking: information overload, errors in subject searching, and the predominant use of the system's simpler options. The results show that the OPAC is broadly used by end-users not only for obtaining printed material, but also for connecting to the electronic resources subscribed to by the library.

Ways of safeguarding historical material in digital form are suggested, and the role of cultural heritage bodies as managers of sustainable digital collections is examined. Design/methodology/approach - The tools available for online access to historical material are discussed, with some comparison made between current efforts on access provision and long-term preservation. Findings - At present, access to historical material in digital form is often given precedence over its preservation. This could have potentially serious long-term implications. Lack of funding for the traditional collecting bodies suggests that new mechanisms for dealing with digital archive collections need to be found. Managing digital material from its creation moves responsibility back to owners, but can provide a platform for effective transfer to new custodians at the appropriate time. Small organisations can participate, increasing the volume and diversity of available material, enriching the base of knowledge upon which history is created. Research limitations/implications - Further research is required into possible models to enable seamless transfer through the custodial chain. Limitation: lack of quantitative analysis of existing and planned digital preservation projects. Originality/value - The paper challenges the status quo and sets out some radical ideas concerning the creation, acquisition, management and preservation of digital records, and the roles of the key stakeholders in the cultural and historical domains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Archives management; Digital libraries; History; Small enterprises; United Kingdom",,"Beagrie, N., Preserving UK digital library collections (2001) Program, 35 (3), pp. 217-26; Beagrie, N., (2003) National Digital Preservation Initiatives: An Overview of Developments in Australia, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom and of Related International Activity, , Council on Library and Information Resources, Library of Congress Washington, DC available at: www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub116/contents.html (accessed 11 July 2005); Brand, S., (2000) The Clock of the Long Now, , Phoenix London; Crace, J., Digital dark age (2003) The Guardian, , 18 March, available at: http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,915847,00.html (accessed 11 July 2005); Dalbello, M., Institutional shaping of cultural memory: Digital library as environment for textual transmission (2004) Library Quarterly, 74 (3), pp. 263-98; Everitt, S., Opportunistic collaboration: Unlocking the archives of the Birmingham Institute of Art & Design (2005) Program, 39 (4); Jones, M., Beagrie, N., (2001) Preservation Management of Digital Materials: A Handbook, , British Library London available at: www.dpconline.org/graphics/intro/index.html (accessed 11 July 2005); Kolbet, R.M., Publish & perish: Printed ephemera and social history (1991) Books at Iowa, 55, pp. 25-36. , available at: www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/Bai/kolbet3.htm (accessed 11 July 2005); Kurzweil, R., Fine living in virtual reality (2002) The Invisible Future: The Seamless Integration of Technology into Everyday Life, pp. 193-215. , Denning, P.

Its metadata are aggregated at a single web site. Six digitization centers at the largest universities in both states digitize their own collections and support partner institutions in their geographic regions. Each center runs a CONTENTdm server, and an aggregating server at the University of Utah harvests metadata into a single searchable index. Local control and identity of collections are hallmarks of the MWDL. Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes the technical structure of the MWDL, focusing on the multi-site server aggregating software from DiMeMa Inc. Findings - The MWDL was the first cooperative digital project to implement this software, and inspired the same infrastructure for a nine-state project known as the Western Waters Digital Library. In 2005 the MWDL will also become the first in the nation to aggregate distributed digital newspaper collections. Practical implications - Describes the creation and aggregation of a distributed regional digital library with digital asset management software that is already in use at over 200 institutions in the US. The solutions implemented in the MWDL offer a mechanism for large and small institutions to work together in a cost-effective manner.

While there are many definitions of genre, most include consideration of the intended communicative purpose, form and sometimes expected content of a document. Most also include the notion of social acceptance, that a document is of a particular genre to the extent that it is recognized as such within a given discourse community. Design/methodology/approach - The article reviews the notion of document genre and its applicability to studies of digital documents and introduces the four articles in the special issue. Findings - Genre can be studied based on intrinsic genre attributes or on the extrinsic function that genre fulfills in human activities. Studies on intrinsic attributes include classifications of genres as clusters of attributes, though these classifications can be problematic because documents can be used in flexible ways. Also, new information technologies have enabled the appearance of novel genres. Studies on extrinsic function include ways to use genre for education or information accesses, as well as the use of genre as a lens for understanding communications in organizations. The four articles in the special issue illustrate these approaches. Originality/value - The paper provides a framework that organizes the range of research about genres of digital documents that should be helpful to those reading this research or planning their own studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Classification; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Research","Classification (of information); Communication systems; Digital storage; Information technology; Professional aspects; Research; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Digital documents; Discourse community; Social recognition; Digital libraries","Bagdanov, A., Worring, M., (2001) Fine-grained Document Genre Classification Using First Order Random Graphs, , paper presented at the Document Analysis and Recognition Conference, Seattle, WA, September; Bazerman, C., Systems of genres and the enactment of social intentions (1995) Genre and the New Rhetoric, pp. 79-101. , Freedman, A.

Most national ethical principles for librarians are represented as professional ethic codes. Each of them eventually consolidates the ideology, the paradigm of national library services. Comparative analysis of national library ethic codes indicates the intellectual freedom principle as the key point and the superior ethical value for library services. With Internet technologies implemented in library services, the principle acquires a new significance and grave problems. Recent information filtering capacities provide a radically new censorship level, including anonymous censorship, violation of user privacy in Internet communications. On the one hand, librarians must follow the intellectual freedom principle, on the other, libraries are humanistic institutions, and librarians have a moral responsibility to the patrons, adhering to the value of human life.

As a fresh, lively and dynamic area with a lot of enthusiasm and activity by researchers from different disciplines, institutions and countries, digital libraries are viewed in different perspectives and the single most development that has brought about sweeping changes in the library and information discipline currently in the developed world is that of digital libraries. Advancements in computer and information technology with breakthroughs in memory technology has not only reduced the cost of infrastructure required for hosting digital libraries, but the demonstrated success of a wide variety of projects in USA and Europe also endorsed the chances of their survival even in a developing country. Though the professionals and libraries in developing countries are also experiencing the virtues of Internet, and electronic information highways, many of these libraries have not gone much farther than the computerization of in-house operations, availing databases in electronic media such as CD-ROMs, and web access of subscribed journals and various free resources. Digital library development should be taken up as an additional task to populate the web sites with valuable in-house content like the research reports, publications of in-house researchers, and so on. Digital library projects and developments in the country are so many, though a large number of them are only at an aggressively enthusiastic preliminary stage. In a country such as India so rich in content of indigenous research and development in disciplines varied from science and technology to social science, humanities and spirituality, there is tremendous need for hosting full fledged digital libraries by appropriately tagging the content with affordable information technology. However, what is lacking, especially in developing countries, is a coordinated collaborative approach to bring in institutions and identifying content valuable for digitization with sufficient monetary and infrastructure support. The digital library development in the country needs a two-pronged strategy (i) to digitize local content, and (ii) to devise options for accessing external resources. Channels for internal content include journals and serials for research, conference proceedings, theses and dissertations and preprints, research and status reports, textbooks and learning materials, government publications, spiritual/heritage sources, tourism information, traditional knowledge, etc. As far as external resources are concerned, there are electronic options from publishers and information provides such as, online access through Web of subscribed journals, CDs and floppies containing supplementary material of printed books, bibliographic/full-text databases, which can be hosted on library servers or intranet along with local content. The problems for digital library development are manifold in India such as lack of interest, non-availability of computer and IT infrastructure for library activities, copyright problems, ensuring secure access, properly selecting content from the mass available, internet bandwidth, absence of sufficient financial support, over concentration of professional time on administrative routines, acute shortage over concentration of professional time on administrative routines, acute shortage of competent manpower, etc. The software boom engulfing the country, as a result of the big leap in computer penetration, sudden rise in proficient manpower, and sizable improvement in communication infrastructure should also be treated as an asset and taken advantage of by authorities and information professionals to create and maintain digital information facilities to usher in the new information age. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The main factors that affect these kinds of efforts are more human and attitudinal than technological or economical. The information environment today is very much conducive enough to tackle the problems faced earlier. With the advent of the Internet and World Wide Web, it is possible to provide instantaneous access to the sources available not only within the organization, but other institutions that participate in the consortia programme. This paper provides a framework for the design and development of an intranet model based on a consortia approach. This model will facilitate information access and use by providing a single Web-enabled window to the information users of the participating institutions in the consortia programme not only to their own resources but sources in the other institutions as well. This will bridge the gap between information resource rich and information deficient libraries and will enhance the information base, shared access and optimum utilization of information resources at an affordable cost.","Cost effectiveness; India; Information technology strategy; Library management; Partnering","Computer hardware; Cost effectiveness; Information management; Information technology; Intranets; World Wide Web; Intranet models; Digital libraries","Fox, E.A., Digital libraries (1995) Communications of the ACM, 38 (4), pp. 23-28. , April; Ranganathan, S.R., (1963) Five Laws of Library Science, , Asia Publishing House, Bombay",Article,Scopus

Quality electronic teaching and research resources, which are of significant value or potential value to academics, universities and the UK Higher Education community in general, are being created at high levels in all types of university. However, since they are not being created with the aim of wider access and use, few are networked, most are difficult to find or in difficult to access electronic formats, and consequently are unlikely to be suitable for reuse by other institutions or even other departments in the host institution. There can also be other problems such as a lack of clarity on the copyright position of resources on university Web sites and a failure to protect potentially valuable university resources from copyright infringement. University management of services offering access to these resources within and beyond the host institution would greatly improve the value that both the host institution and UK Higher Education as a whole obtain from this material and the effort that goes into creating it - particularly if local efforts were co-ordinated nationally to ensure resource design standardisation and service interoperability. Universities appear to regard the issue as important and see the advantages of managing services as outweighing the disadvantages. Most institutions appear to envisage University Libraries playing a key role in the management of services.",,"Information analysis; Information management; Information services; Teaching; Websites; Electronic resources; Electronic teaching; Digital libraries","catriona2.lib.strath.ac.uk/catrionawww.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elibwww.lib.strath.ac.ukwww.napier.ac.uk/depts/libhome.htmlbubl.ac.uk/org/scurlW269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/all-q.htmlwp269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/surveys.html#SECT8, wp269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/catconts.htmSee outline remit: Wp269.lib.strath.ac.uk/starweb/dio.html - use usernameguest and password tem- porary to accesswp269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/issues.html",Article,Scopus

Substantial research funding has become available, libraries are actively involved in DL projects and conferences, journals and online news lists proliferate. This article explores reasons for these developments and the influence of key players, while speculating on future directions. We find that the term 'digital library' is used in two distinct senses. In general, researchers view digital libraries as content collected on behalf of user communities, while practicing librarians view digital libraries as institutions or services. Tensions exist between these communities over the scope and concept of the term 'library'. Research-oriented definitions serve to build a community of researchers and to focus attention on problems to be addressed; these definitions have expanded considerably in scope throughout the 1990s. Library community definitions are more recent and serve to focus attention on practical challenges to be addressed in the transformation of research libraries and universities. Future trends point toward the need for extensive research in digital libraries and for the transformation of libraries as institutions. The present ambiguity of terminology is hindering the advance of research and practice in digital libraries and in our ability to communicate the scope and significance of our work.",,"Data handling; Information retrieval systems; Information technology; Libraries; Research and development management; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Terminology; Community development; Digital libraries; Information infrastructure; International; Services; Universities; Database systems","Battin, P., Leadership in a transformational age (1998) The Mirage of Continuity: Reconfiguring Academic Information Resources for the 21st Century, pp. 260-270. , B.
