There is no universally agreed standard in the current state of robotics for both academic and industrial practice. This forces authors to re-implement requisite parts. Even for well-defined approaches, algorithms are being recomposed without any new contribution. Motivated from these concerns and discussions, the virtual tool, MFOCV, is introduced in order to encourage the use of open-source libraries. Without struggling the complexity, discarding with re-implementation of admitted methods MFOCV is designed to investigate camera parameters and basic transformation which are the initial steps for the localization and 3D reconstruction. With the utilization of open-source libraries it is expected that the interests on open architecture will grow and robotics attract more new researchers/groups. MFOCV enables user to observe effects of different camera parameters simultaneously on real images. The presented tool can be used not only for parameter auditing in lectures but also in instrumental localization problems in operative projects. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The importance of tracking practice trends as part of the ongoing curriculum revision process is emphasized. Linking both education and research to practice will be crucial to the success of future educational programs and the ability of graduates to make a useful contribution in the workplace. Workforce tracking of alumni is a key component of effective strategic planning and overall workforce planning, especially in a time of major demographic change.

Despite the variety of name disambiguation methods available in the literature to solve the problem, most of them are rarely compared against each other. Moreover, they are often evaluated without considering a time evolving digital library, susceptible to dynamic (and therefore challenging) patterns such as the introduction of new authors and the change of researchers' interests over time. In order to facilitate the evaluation of name disambiguation methods in various realistic scenarios and under controlled conditions, in this article we propose SyGAR, a new Synthetic Generator of Authorship Records that generates citation records based on author profiles. SyGAR can be used to generate successive loads of citation records simulating a living digital library that evolves according to various publication patterns. We validate SyGAR by comparing the results produced by three representative name disambiguation methods on real as well as synthetically generated collections of citation records. We also demonstrate its applicability by evaluating those methods on a time evolving digital library collection generated with the tool, considering several dynamic and realistic scenarios. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

On account of their role in the academic community, it is very important that these digital libraries collect citations in a consistent, accurate, and up-to-date manner, yet they do not correctly compile citations for myriads of authors for various reasons including authors with the same name, a problem known as the ""name ambiguity problem."" This problem occurs when multiple authors share the same name and particularly when names are simplified as in cases where names merely contain the first initial and the last name. This paper proposes a reliable and accurate pair-wise similarities approach to disambiguate names using supervised classification on Web correlations and authorship correlations. This approach makes use of Web correlations among citations assuming citations that co-refer on publication lists on the Web should to refer to the same author. This approach also makes use of authorship correlations assuming citations with the same rare author name refer to the same author, and furthermore, citations with the same full names of authors or e-mail addresses likely refer to the same author. These two types of correlations are measured in our approach using pair-wise similarity metrics. In addition, a binary classifier, as part of supervised classification, is applied to label matching pairs of citations using pair-wise similarity metrics, and these labels are then used to group citations into different clusters such that each cluster represents an individual author.

The challenges of dealing with author name ambiguity have led to a myriad of disambiguation methods. Generally speaking, the proposed methods usually attempt to group citation records of a same author by finding some similarity among them or try to directly assign them to their respective authors. Both approaches may either exploit supervised or unsupervised techniques. In this article, we propose a taxonomy for characterizing the current author name disambiguation methods described in the literature, present a brief survey of the most representative ones and discuss several open challenges.",,"Automatic method; Disambiguation method; Hard problems; Name disambiguation; Bibliographic retrieval systems; Digital libraries; Surveys","Bagga, A., Baldwin, B., Algorithms for scoring coreference chains (1998) LREC, pp. 563-566; Bekkerman, R., McCallum, A., Disambiguating web appearances of people in a social network (2005) WWW, pp. 463-470; Bhattacharya, I., Getoor, L., A latent dirichlet model for unsupervised entity resolution (2006) SDM; Bhattacharya, I., Getoor, L., Collective entity resolution in relational data ACM TKDD, 1 (1), p. 2007; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) JMLR, 3, pp. 993-1022; Cohen, W.W., Ravikumar, P.D., Fienberg, S.E., A comparison of string distance metrics for name-matching tasks (2003) IIWeb, pp. 73-78; Cota, R.G., Ferreira, A.A., Gonçalves, M.A., Laender, A.H.F., Nascimento, C., An unsupervised heuristic-based hierarchical method for name disambiguation in bibliographic citations (2010) JASIST, 61 (9), pp. 1853-1870; Crammer, K., Singer, Y., Ultraconservative online algorithms for multiclass problems (2003) JMLR, 3, pp. 951-991; Culotta, A., Kanani, P., Hall, R., Wick, M., McCallum, A., Author disambiguation using error-driven machine learning with a ranking loss function (2007) IIWeb; De Carvalho, A.P., Ferreira, A.A., Laender, A.H.F., Gonçalves, M.A., Incremental unsupervised name disambiguation in cleaned digital libraries (2011) JIDM, 2 (3), pp. 289-304; Dempster, A., Laird, N., Rubin, D., Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm (1977) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

However, few studies examine the problem of ranking objects in these networks. In this paper, we study this problem and present a novel model, called PAV, for ranking heterogeneous objects, such as authors, papers, and venues. Based on PAV model, we transform the problem of ranking objects into the problem of estimating probability distribution. We propose an efficient algorithm to estimate probability parameters by use of the fact that the PAV model is a regular Markov chain. For evaluating PAV model, we apply it on one real dataset, which was crawled from ACM Digital Library. The experimental results show that the proposed model is effective. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

With the assumption that dentists would find the digital textbooks useful for patient care, the authors surveyed recent graduates to determine if their attitude toward the VitalSource Bookshelf had changed. A brief survey was sent to 119 alumni from the classes of 2009 and 2010 of one U.S. dental school. Forty-seven (39.5 percent) completed the questionnaire. Eighteen respondents (48.3 percent) reported using the etextbooks often or sometimes. The twenty-nine dentists who said they have not used the collection since graduation reported preferring print books or other online sources or having technical problems when downloading the books to a new computer. Only five respondents selected the VitalSource Bookshelf as a preferred source of professional information. Most of the respondents reported preferring to consult colleagues (37.8 percent), the Internet (20 percent), or hardcopy books (17.8 percent) for information. When asked in an open-ended question to state their opinion of the Bookshelf, nineteen (42.2 percent) responded positively, but almost one-third of these only liked the search feature. Six respondents reported that they never use the program. Twenty-two said they have had technical problems with the Bookshelf, including fifteen who have not been able to install it on a new computer. Many of them said they have not followed up with either the dental school or VitalSource support services to overcome this problem.

Design/methodology/approach: The researchers systemically surveyed and reviewed publications related to information literacy and library user education. Findings: It was found that a well-designed information literacy program benefits the library and its staff, faculty, and students; librarians should play a leading role in the design and operation of programs, but collaboration with faculty, IT professionals and students is essential; programs should be embedded in the curriculum, be largely cooperative, and be problem-based; evaluation and assessment are essential components; emphasis should be placed on first-year students; and, ideally, the librarians will turn into educators and the library will become a learning center combining learning, research and technology. Research limitations/implications: This paper reflects the opinions of the researchers and the authors of the reviewed literature who have insights into the issues related to information literacy and library user education. These opinions present useful guidelines for both librarian and teacher practitioners. Originality/value: This paper provides a point of view on the relationship between information literacy and library user education in the six themes described above. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Electronic document delivery; Information literacy; Library tutorial; Library user education; University libraries","Design and operations; Design/methodology/approach; Electronic document delivery; Essential component; Evaluation and assessment; First year students; Information literacy; IT professional; Learning center; Library user education; Library users; Problem-based; Research limitations; University libraries; Curricula; Engineering research; Information services; Libraries; Students; Teaching; Word processing; Digital libraries","Akeroyd, J., The management of change in electronic libraries (2001) IFLA Journal, 27 (2), pp. 70-73; Presidential Committee on Information Literacy (1999), www.ala.org/acrl/nili/nlit1st.html, Final Report, Chicago, available at (accessed 27 January 2009) American Library AssociationArmstrong, A., First-year experience research skills survey (2003) Assessing Student Learning Outcomes for Information Literacy Instruction in Academic Institutions, pp. 53-59. , Avery, E.

Such name ambiguity decreases the performance of document retrieval, Web search, information integration, and may cause confusion in other applications. Due to the same name spellings and lack of information, it is a nontrivial task to distinguish them accurately. In this article, we focus on investigating the problem in digital libraries to distinguish publications written by authors with identical names. We present an effective framework named GHOST (abbreviation for GrapHical framewOrk for name diSambiguaTion), to solve the problem systematically. We devise a novel similarity metric, and utilize only one type of attribute (i.e., coauthorship) in GHOST. Given the similarity matrix, intermediate results are grouped into clusters with a recently introduced powerful clustering algorithm called Affinity Propagation. In addition, as a complementary technique, user feedback can be used to enhance the performance. We evaluated the framework on the real DBLP and PubMed datasets, and the experimental results show that GHOST can achieve both high precision and recall. ©2011 ACM.","Clustering; Graph; Name disambiguation; Similarity","Affinity propagation; Clustering; Coauthorship; Data sets; Document Retrieval; Graph; Graph-based; High precision; Information integration; Intermediate results; Name disambiguation; Non-trivial tasks; Other applications; Similarity; Similarity matrix; Similarity metrics; User feedback; Web searches; Digital libraries; Information retrieval; World Wide Web; Clustering algorithms","Basu, S., Bilenko, M., Mooney, R.J., A probabilistic framework for semi-supervised clustering (2004) KDD-2004 - Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 59-68. , KDD-2004 - Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Bekkerman, R., Mccallum, A., Disambiguating web appearances of people in a social network (2005) Proceedings of the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW'05)., pp. 463-470; Bhattacharya, I., Getoor, L., Collective entity resolution in relational data (2007) ACM Trans.

Academic libraries are becoming very involved in managing electronic scholarly products and participating in the evolving scholarly communication process through institutional repositories. Although institutional repositories can make room for easier access to universities' research output, unfortunately it is not fully developed in some academic institutions. The origin of this problem is that there are known instances where librarians in-charge of institutional repository are unaware of their roles, and are unskilled in implementing the institutional repository. This paper describes a study conducted on the roles of librarians in the deployment and content recruitment of institutional repositories in eight (8) universities in Malaysia. Sample for this study are librarians who are involved with the development and implementation of institutional repository in their respective universities. The study reveals that the act of collecting materials for depositing is mainly done by librarians rather than the authors and researchers. Providing training sessions, holding meetings in departments and faculties, and also linking of the institutional repository website from the university and faculties' website have the highest rank in librarians' approach to promote the institutional repository. The paper also discusses the process of depositing, motivation factors, roles, marketing and benefits of institutional repository that will have reference value for the librarians who desire to embark on an institutional repository.","Academic libraries; Digital libraries; Institutional repositories; Malaysia; Open access initiatives; Roles of librarians",,"Abrizah, A., Piloting an institutional repository at a research-intensive university: Strategies for content recruitment and the role of the library (2010) World Digital Libraries, 3 (1), pp. 23-29; Abrizah, A., Kiran, K., Edzan, N.N., Zainab, A.N., Making Malaysian research available through publishing in Open Access E-journals and E-prints (2007) Persidangan Kebangsaan Ilmiah MAPIM, pp. 9-11; Allard, S., Mack, T.R., Feltner-Reichert, M., The librarian's role in institutional repositories (2005) Reference Services Review, 33 (3), pp. 325-336; Bailey, C.W., (2005) Open access bibliography: Liberating scholarly literature with e-prints and open access journals, , Association of Research Libraries Washington, DC; Barton, M., Murray, A., Holley, R., Planning for institutional repositories in the United Kingdom (2003) SCONUL Newsletter, 29, pp. 56-58; Bell, S., Institutional repositories: What will it take to fill them?

DL technologies have powerful and flexible content management and access functionalities, whereas ontology helps teachers and students to link content materials to their learning objectives. This paper demonstrates that the integration provides a powerful and meaningful e-learning environment. Design/methodology/approach - DiLight is designed as an interactive e-learning system that integrates DL and ontology technologies. By conducting comparative experiments involving DiLight in students' actual learning process, the authors examined the advantages and limitations of DiLight in e-learning. Findings - Compared to a widely used e-learning environment, DiLight can provide significantly better support for students' complex IA tasks because DiLight is more useful for relationship discovery and problem solving. DiLight is also effective even when students were either less familiar with tasks or felt that they were more difficult. There is no single best access method for all learning situations. Therefore, multiple IA methods should be built into e-learning systems. Although most of time the search was the first choice of the students, ontology-based methods were useful in supporting them to complete their tasks too. Originality/value - This is a comparative empirical study using an interactive e-learning system called DiLight to explore the usage of integrated DL and ontology in e-learning. The experiment results demonstrate the value of the multiple IA methods provided by DL, and the usefulness of integrating DL with ontology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; E-learning; Facilities; Information","Access methods; Comparative experiments; Content management; Design/methodology/approach; E-learning environment; Empirical studies; Information; Information access; Interactive E-Learning system; Learning objectives; Learning process; Learning situation; Ontology technology; Ontology-based; Digital libraries; E-learning; Experiments; Information retrieval; Integration; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Ontology; Semantics; Students; Engineering education","Acosta-Diaz, R., Guillen, H.M., GarciaRuiz, M.A., Gallardo, A.R., Pulido, J.R.G., Reyes, P.D., An open source platform for indexing and retrieval of multimedia information from a digital library of graduate thesis (2006) Proceedings of the World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, & Higher Education E-Learning, pp. 1822-1829. , Association for the Advancement of Computers in Education, Chesapeake, VA; Ahn, J.-W., Brusilovsky, P., Sonsnovsky, S., Quizvibe: Accessing educational objects with adaptive relevance-based visualization (2006) Proceedings of the World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, & Higher Education E-Learning, pp. 2707-2714. , AACE, Chesapeake, VA; Alexander, S., McKenzie, J., (1998) An Evaluation of Information Technology Projects in University Learning, , Department of Employment, Education and Training and Youth Affairs, Australian Government Publishing Services, Canberrra; Bloom, B.S., Krathwohl, D.R., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals Handbook I: Cognitive Domain, , Longmans, Green, NY; Borgman, C., (2000) From Gutenberg to Global Information Infrastructure, , MITPress, Boston, MA; Brown, W.E., Lovett, M., Bajzek, D.M., Burnette, J.M., Improving the feedback cycle to improve learning in introductory biology using the digital dashboard (2006) Proceedings of the World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, & Higher Education, pp. 1030-1035. , AACE, Chesapeake, VA; Brusilovsky, P., Adaptive and intelligent technologies for web-based education (1999) Kunstliche Intelligenz, 4, pp. 19-25. , (Special Issue on Intelligent Systems and Teleteaching); Brusilovsky, P., Peylo, C., Adaptive and intelligent web-based educational systems (2003) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 13 (2-4), pp. 159-172; Burgess, J.R.D., Russell, J.E.A., The effectiveness of distance learning initiatives in organizations (2003) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 63 (2), pp. 289-303; Carlson, L.E., Sullivan, J.F., Hands-on engineering: Learning by doing in the integrated teaching and learning program (1999) International Journal on Engineering Education, 15 (1), pp. 20-31; Conlan, O., Hampson, C., O'Keeffe, I., Heller, J., Using knowledge space theory to support learner modeling and personalization (2006) Proceedings of the World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, & Higher Education, pp. 1912-1919. , AACE, Chesapeake, VA; DeRouin, R.E., Fritzsche, B.A., Salas, E., E-learning in organizations (2005) Journal of Management, 31 (6), pp. 920-940; Dicheva, D., Dichev, C., A framework for concept-based digital course libraries (2004) Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 15 (4), pp. 347-364; Falquet, G., Ziswiler, J.C., A virtual hyperbooks model to support collaborative learning (2005) International Journal on E-Learning, 4 (1), pp. 39-56; Galagan, P.A., The e-learning revolution (2000) Training & Development, 54 (12), pp. 24-30; Greenwald, A.G., Within-subjects designs: To use or not to use?

With the rapid growth of the Web, however, large amounts of information are generated daily. Therefore, it is generally difficult for researchers to obtain information related to their own areas and novel technologies from huge data residing in the Web. Furthermore, they often try to apply the technologies of their own fields to other different areas to solve existing difficult problems or improve the performance of existing systems. Hence, it is important to discover joint research topics in which technologies of particular research areas are applied to other different areas in order to recognize and follow various current trends. In this paper, we propose a novel method to discover joint research topics using a traversing algorithm based on social networks representing the relations among the authors of papers, and describe some experimental results to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Digital library; Joint research topics; Social networks; Traversing algorithm",,"Gori, M., Pucci, A., (2006) Research Paper Recommender Systems: A Random-Walk Based Approach, pp. 778-781. , Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 06); McNee, S., Kapoor, N., Konstan, J., (2006) Don't Look Stupid: Avoiding Pitfalls when Recommending Research Papers, pp. 171-180. , Proceedings of the 2006 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW 06); Bollacker, K., Lawrence, S., Giles, C., Discovering Relevant Scientific Literature on the Web (2000) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 15, pp. 42-47; Lawrence, S., Bollacker, K., Giles, C., (1999) Indexing and retrieval of scientific literature, pp. 139-146. , Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 99); Watanabe, S., Ito, T., Ozono, T., Shintani, T., (2005) A Paper Recommendation Mechanism for The Research Support System Papits, pp. 71-80. , Proceedings of the International Workshop on Data Engineering Issues in E-Commerce (DEEC 05); Baghi, H., Barouni-Ebrahimi, M., Ghorbani, A., Zafarani, R., (2007) Connecta!: An Intelligent Search Engine based on Authors' Connectivity, pp. 133-140. , Proceedings of the 5th Annual Conference on Communication Networks and Services Research (CNSR 07); McNee, S., Albert, I., Cosley, D., Gopalkrishnan, P., Lam, S., Rashid, A., Konstan, J., Riedl, J., (2002) On the Recommending of Citations for Research Papers, pp. 116-125. , Proceedings of the 2002 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW 02); Zaiane, O., Chen, J., Goebel, R., (2007) DBconnect: Mining Research Community on DBLP Data, pp. 74-81. , Proceedings of the 9th WebKDD and 1st SNA-KDD 2007 Workshop on Web Mining and Social Network Analysis (WebKDD/SNAKDD 07); http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/, Porter's Stemming AlgorithmGreengrass, E., (2000), http://www.cs.umbc.edu/research/cadip/readings/IR.report.120600.book.pdf, Information Retrieval: A Survey, Internet AvailableCormack, G., Lhotak, O., Palmer, C., (1999) Estimating Precision by Random Sampling, pp. 273-274. , Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 99)",Article,Scopus

In this article,we present a heuristic-based hierarchical clustering method to deal with this problem. The method successively fuses clusters of citations of similar author names based on several heuristics and similarity measures on the components of the citations (e.g., coauthor names, work title, and publication venue title). During the disambiguation task, the information about fused clusters is aggregated providing more information for the next round of fusion. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we ran a series of experiments in two different collections extracted from real-world digital libraries and compared it, under two metrics, with four representative methods described in the literature. We present comparisons of results using each considered attribute separately (i.e., coauthor names, work title, and publication venue title) with the author name attribute and using all attributes together. These results show that our unsupervised method, when using all attributes, performs competitively against all other methods, under both metrics, loosing only in one case against a supervised method, whose result was very close to ours. Moreover, such results are achieved without the burden of any training and without using any privileged information such as knowing a priori the correct number of clusters. © 2010 ASIS&T.",,"Bibliographic citations; Hierarchical clustering methods; Hierarchical method; Name disambiguation; Number of clusters; Real-world; Research communities; Similarity measure; Unsupervised method; Digital libraries; Heuristic methods","Baeza-Yates, R.A., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc; Bekkerman, R., McCallum, A., Disambiguating web appearances of people in a social network (2005) Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 463-470. , New York: ACM Press; Bhattacharya, I., Getoor, L., A latent Dirichlet model for unsupervised entity resolution (2006) The Sixth SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, , http://www.ibhattacharya.net/DOCS/sdm06.pdf, April, Paper presented at, Bethesda, MD.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the insights gained from research projects involving hundreds of thousands of people, the paper first analyses the whys, wherefores, implications, effects and challenges of the ""information malnutrition"" problem and then proceeds to investigate the ways and means for its holistic solution. Findings: Although in today's information-saturated world people have vast amounts of information at their beck and call, their myriad information needs often go unmet. Fortunately, changing this picture of ineffectual information consumption is quite feasible. The key to it all is achieving a nuanced understanding of people's idiosyncratic needs through ongoing assessment, utilising the analytical framework offered up for the purpose by the authors. It falls to information professionals, then, to see to the true information enfranchisement of the digital consumer, for it is their proclaimed mission to ensure that people's information needs are handled effectively. This can be done directly, via the proficient planning and delivery of information provision, but also indirectly, by spreading professional thinking and practices to those who insist on sorting out their information needs on their own. Originality/value: The paper offers a new approach to the much-debated problem of ensuring that people really benefit from the information abundance that is available to them, which is firmly grounded in theory, but, nevertheless, highly practical. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Generation and dissemination of information; Information profession; User studies","Design/methodology/approach; Generation and dissemination of information; Information abundance; Information need; Information profession; Information professionals; Information provision; New approaches; User study; Digital libraries; Information services; Nutrition; Information dissemination","Adams, A., Blandford, A., Lunt, P., Social empowerment and exclusion: A case study on digital libraries (2005) ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 12 (2), pp. 174-200; Belkin, N.J., Vickery, A., (1989) Interaction in Information Systems: A Review of Research from Document Retrieval to Knowledge-Based Systems, , British Library, London; Biggs, M., Sources of tension between librarians and faculty (1981) The Journal of Higher Education, 52 (2), pp. 182-201; Bilton, N., Is Amazon working backward?

Design/methodology/approach: Text mining techniques were used to identify duplicate references. Moreover, the process of identifying syntactically different data was improved with the automated discovery of thesauri from correctly matched data, and the generated thesaurus was further used in semantic clustering. The results were effectively visually represented. Findings: The paper finds that the function based on the Jaro-Winkler algorithm may be efficiently used in the de-duplication process. A generated thesaurus that utilises domain-specific knowledge can also be used in the semantic clustering of references. It was shown that semantic clustering may be most useful in partitioning data, which is particularly significant when dealing with large amounts of data, which is usually the case. Moreover, those references that have the same or similar scores may be considered as candidate matches in the further de-duplication process. Finally, it proved to be a more efficient way of visually representing the results.

Design/methodology/approach - The author began researching metadata use in Thailand in 2003 and 2004 while on sabbatical from the University of Vermont. A small number of government libraries were in the process of building up their digital databases. These were identified from a survey conducted by the author at that time. The author continues to monitor the development of digital initiatives and has identified several new digital initiatives created by academic institutions since then. The digital initiatives operated by Thai government agencies and academic institutions that existed in 2007 are presented, along with one example of a metadata record randomly selected from each of these projects. These examples illustrate Dublin Core metadata use and cataloguing practice employed in these digital databases. The author's current research on the development of digital initiatives is included. Findings - This paper presents what the author feels are some significant technical and legal issues facing Thai digital initiatives. A major copyright issue in Thailand, the ineffective enforcement of intellectual property laws relating to access rights, is presented. Also discussed is the significant obstacle to record retrieval created by the structure and complexity of the Thai language.

The study revealed that SDI-and DSM-based information support show signs of decline rather than development. Evidently, this can be attributed to economic and technological reasons. SDI services abroad are developing dynamically on the basis of new technologies and resources. In many countries, a number of libraries, publishing houses, and information centers make wide use of SDI based on web information filtering systems.

Design/methodology/ approach - This study selects six digital libraries to represent a variety of digital libraries developed or sponsored by different types of organisations. The Help features of these selected digital libraries are examined by their types (explicit versus implicit), formats (texts, images, screenshots, multimedia materials, and interactive formats), and presentation styles (descriptive, guided, procedural, and exemplary). Findings - This study presents the types of Help features available in the selected digital libraries, and further characterises the formats and presentation styles of these Help features. In the process of analysis, the author also identifies six types of problems: lack of standards; tradeoff between using explicit Help and implicit help; tradeoff between using general Help versus specific Help; lack of interactive Help features; lack of dynamic presentation styles; and lack of Help features for advanced users and users who do not understand English. Research limitations/implications - In order to design Help features that facilitate users to effectively use digital libraries, further research needs to extend studies to what types of help-seeking situations users generally encounter and the corresponding support they need.

It aims to discuss this search engine, which is intended exclusively for searching scholarly documents, and then empirically test its most important functionality. The focus is on an exploratory study which investigates the coverage of scientific serials in GS. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on queries against different journal lists: international scientific journals from Thomson Scientific (SCI, SSCI, AH), open access journals from the DOAJ list and journals from the German social sciences literature database SOLIS as well as the analysis of result data from GS. All data gathering took place in August 2006. Findings - The study shows deficiencies in the coverage and up-to-dateness of the GS index. Furthermore, the study points out which web servers are the most important data providers for this search service and which information sources are highly represented. The paper can show that there is a relatively large gap in Google Scholar's coverage of German literature as well as weaknesses in the accessibility of Open Access content. Major commercial academic publishers are currently the main data providers. Research limitations/implications - Five different journal lists were analysed, including approximately 9,500 single titles. The lists are from different fields and of various sizes. This limits comparability. There were also some problems matching the journal titles of the original lists to the journal title data provided by Google Scholar. The study was only able to analyse the top 100 Google Scholar hits per journal. Practical implications - The paper concludes that Google Scholar has some interesting pros (such as citation analysis and free materials) but the service cannot be seen as a substitute for the use of special abstracting and indexing databases and library catalogues due to various weaknesses (such as transparency, coverage and up-to-dateness). Originality/value - The authors do not know of any other study using such a brute force approach and such a large empirical basis. The study can be considered as using brute force in the sense that it gathered lots of data from Google and then analysed the data in a macroscopic way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Electronic journals; Search engines; Serials; Worldwide web","Abstracting; Data reduction; Database systems; Search engines; Social sciences; Web services; Websites; Electronic journals; Google Scholar (GS); Serials; Digital libraries","Banks, M.A., The excitement of Google Scholar, the worry of Google Print (2005) Biomedical Digital Libraries, 2 (2). , available at: www.bio-diglib.com/content/2/1/2; Bar-Ilan, J., An ego-centric citation analysis of the works of Michael O.

Design/methodology/approach - One challenge for designers in the context of large-scale repositories is to create interface tools that help users find specific information of interest. In order to be most effective, these tools need to leverage the cognitive characteristics of the target users. At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the authors' target users are scientists and engineers who can be characterized as higher-order, analytical thinkers. In this paper, the authors describe a visualization tool they have created for making the authors' large-scale digital object repositories more usable for them: SearchGraph, which facilitates data set analysis by displaying search results in the form of a two- or three-dimensional interactive scatter plot. Findings - Using SearchGraph, users can view a condensed, abstract visualization of search results. They can view the same dataset from multiple perspectives by manipulating several display, sort, and filter options. Doing so allows them to see different patterns in the dataset. For example, they can apply a logarithmic transformation in order to create more scatter in a dense cluster of data points or they can apply filters in order to focus on a specific subset of data points. Originality/value - SearchGraph is a creative solution to the problem of how to design interface tools for large-scale repositories. It is particularly appropriate for the authors' target users, who are scientists and engineers. It extends the work of the first two authors on ActiveGraph, a read-write digital library visualization tool.","Digital libraries; Information; Visual media",,"Card, S.K., Mackinlay, J.D., Shneiderman, B., (1999) Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers San Francisco, CA; Collins, L.M., (2006) ""Information Visualization and Large-scale Repositories"", , Panel on Search Results Visualization.

Therefore, it is important to design searching and browsing tools that support them. However, many interfaces for children do not consider their skills and preferences. Children are capable of creating Boolean queries using category browsers, but have difficulty with the hierarchies used in many category-browsing interfaces because different branches of the hierarchy must be navigated sequentially and top-level categories are often too abstract for them to understand. Based on previous research, the authors believe using a flat category structure, where only leaf-level categories are available and can be viewed simultaneously, might better support children. However, this design introduces many more items on the screen and the need for paging or scrolling, all potential usability problems. To evaluate these tradeoffs, the authors conducted two studies with children searching and browsing using two types of category browsers in the International Children's Digital Library. Their results suggest that a flat, simultaneous interface provides advantages over a hierarchical, sequential interface for children in both Boolean searching and casual browsing. These results add to our understanding of children's searching and browsing skills and preferences, and possibly serve as guidelines for other children's interface designers.",,"Boolean algebra; Computer aided design; Digital libraries; Query languages; Usability engineering; User interfaces; Web browsers; Boolean queries; Casual browsing; Sequential navigation; Usability problems; Search engines","Ahlberg, C., Shneiderman, B., Visual information seeking: Tight coupling of dynamic query filters with starfield displays (1994) Proceedings of Human Factors in Computing, pp. 313-317; Borgman, C., Hirsh, S., Walter, A., Gallagher, A., Children's searching behavior on browsing and keyword online catalogs: The Science Library Catalog project (1995) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 46 (9), pp. 663-684; Busey, P., Doerr, T., Kid's catalog: An information retrieval system for children (1993) Youth Services in Libraries, 7 (1), pp. 77-84; (2002) Connected to the future: A report on children's, , http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/connected, Corporation for Public Broadcasting CPB, internet use.

Design/methodology/approach - Different categories of digital collections based on guidelines defined by the authors are presented. Issues related to public access are illustrated. A model using the FRBR entities relationships is proposed to improve the accessibility of digital cultural materials so that scholarly research can be enhanced. The number of digital collections has been increased significantly since the late 1990s, but few studies investigated how these collections were organized and managed. To attain an understanding of the current status of institutional digital collections, various collection sites were examined and analyzed. The study focused on the existence and level of richness of bibliographic descriptions provided for each image; whether a search engine was available or not; how easily the search could be performed; and how search results were organized. The presentation of search results is problematic. Applying the IFLA FRBR model to digital materials can bring a solution. Findings - The IFLA FRBR model presents the search results hierarchically so that related materials can be easily collocated. This feature meets the end-users needs. The attributes of work and expression entities presented in the IFLA FRBR model should be applied differently for event-based digital cultural materials. Defining work- or expression-level entities under the event or theme will be more logical than under author and/or title for cultural materials. Doing expression-level cataloging might also work for this type of materials. Originality/value - Before building a digital collection, institutions should have a well-thought-out and well-planned collection management mechanism. Metadata scheme, content standards and content management system are important fundamentals. Much can be done to improve the accessibility of digital collections. The proposed FRBRized approach will make the retrieval of digital cultural objects easier.","Cataloguing; Content management; Digital libraries; Search engines",,"Besser, H., ""Image databases: The first decade, the present, and the future"" (1997) Digital Image Access and Retrieval, pp. 11-28. , Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Heidorn, P.B.

The digital library contains four types of learning modules including textual materials, QuickTime virtual reality movies, Java simulations, and stereolithographic files of the physical models. The authors report an evaluation study on the uses of the KMODDL in two undergraduate classes. This research reveals that the users in different classes encountered different usability problems, and reported quantitatively different subjective experiences. Further, the results indicate that depending on the subject area, the two user groups preferred different types of learning modules, resulting in different uses of the available materials and different learning outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach - Using secondary literature, the author established a hypothesis about the way in which academic researchers engage with electronic texts. It is argued that academics are often distrustful of the authenticity of much that appears in digital form and doubtful as to its accuracy. The case studies are used as a means to demonstrate the measures that library and information professionals can take to assuage these concerns. Findings - Given reasonable financial resources and staff, it is relatively easy to adopt a transparently academic approach. Accuracy is much more problematic, and is often compromised by the unwieldy nature of these types of projects. Originality/value - Most evaluations of digitisation projects have not focused on the issues of academic authenticity and textual accuracy; indeed, the latter is difficult to gauge when the ASCII text is hidden and where there is little incentive for designers to be honest about the potential flaws in their search engines. Also, there has been little discussion in academic literature on the distribution of staff and financial resources within projects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accuracy; Digital libraries; History; Ireland; Quality assurance",,"Chapman, S., Working with printed text and manuscripts (2000) Handbook for Digital Projects: A Management Tool for Preservation and Access, pp. 113-20. , Sitts, M.K.

The paper analyses the step-by-step approach taken in carrying out the migration successfully. Reasons for the retroconversion and the method of acquisition of the new software are discussed. Also, the problems emanating from the peculiarities of the software and the practical approach used in solving such problems are discussed in detail. The treatment given to accession numbers, reference materials, books with multiple authors and gifts and donations to the library is highlighted. Also, the benefits of the project to the Development Policy Centre (DPC) and other libraries were discussed. The paper concludes that with the successful migration project of the DPC library, the conditions are favourable for a wider usage of the software in Nigerian libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Library automation; Nigeria; Research libraries","Automation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Digital libraries; Information services; Library automation; Nigeria; Research libraries; Libraries","Kawamanto, C., ""File analysis for retrospective conversion: The case of California State library, Law Library"" (1987) Law Library Journal, 79 (3), p. 462; Olorunsola, R., ""Retroconversion project in a Nigerian university library: Setting the parameters"" (1997) OCLC Systems & Services, 13 (3), pp. 87-90; Olorunsola, R., ""Staff training aspects of automation in a Nigerian university library"" (1997) Aslib Proceedings, 49 (2), pp. 38-42; Sam, J., Sereboo, M.A., ""Use of micro CDS/ISIS in libraries and information centres in Ghana"" (2000) African Journal of Library, Archival & Information Science, 10 (2), pp. 187-191; (2000) A User's Guide on CDS/ISIS for Windows, , Unesco, Unesco, Paris",Article,Scopus

Two epistemological positions leading to different solutions in digital library (DL) design are examined: the information transfer perspective and the social contructionist knowledge production perspective. The first section of the paper explores how the information transfer perspective affects the principles by which documents are organized in DLs. The second section analyzes the basic assumptions of the knowledge production perspective. The third section discusses how social constructionist ideas affect the design principles and information architecture of DLs. The authors suggest that, in the electronic information environment, traditional noun-based approaches can be replaced by solutions that combine verbs and nouns to visualize the structure of conversations concerning a particular issue or topic. Finally, the potentials and problems of building constructionist digital libraries are discussed.",,"Data transfer; Information retrieval systems; Information science; Knowledge engineering; Electronic information; Digital libraries","Agre, P., Institutional circuitry: Thinking about the forms and uses of information (1995) Information Technology and Libraries, 14, pp. 225-230; Berners-Lee, T., (1999) Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its Inventor, , San Francisco, CA: Harper; Bishop, A.P., Mehra, B., Bazzell, I., Smith, C., Socially grounded user studies in digital library development (2000) First Monday, 5. , http//firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_6/bishop/index.html; Bishop, A.P., Bazzell, I., Mehra, B., Smith, C., Afya: Social and digital technologies that reach across the digital divide (2001) First Monday, 6. , http//firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_4/bishop/index.html; Blair, D.C., (1990) Language and Representation in Information Retrieval, , Amsterdam: Elsevier; Borgman, C.L., What are digital libraries?

The main emphasis over the past decade has been on making a few basic tools (for instance, browsers and search mechanisms) powerful, versatile and easy to use. Coleman and Oxnam (2002) suggest both improving the usability of current tools and developing new ones. This article suggests focusing on the use of tools for searching digital information. The power of a search mechanism depends not only on how it is constructed but also on how it is used. Coleman and Oxnam ask: ""How can interactional digital libraries enhance and augment human capabilities?""

As described in the recent book The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure, this Grid will connect the nation's computers, databases, instruments, and people in a seamless web of computing and distributed intelligence, which can be used in an on-demand fashion as a problem-solving resource in many fields of human endeavor-and, in particular, science and engineering. The availability of grid resources will give rise to dramatically new classes of applications, in which computing resources are no longer localized but, rather, distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic; computation is increasingly sophisticated and multidisciplinary; and computation is integrated into our daily lives and, hence, subject to stricter time constraints than at present. The impact of these new applications will be pervasive, ranging from new systems for scientific inquiry, through computing support for crisis management, to the use of ambient computing to enhance personal mobile computing environments. To realize this vision, significant scientific and technical obstacles must be overcome. Principal among these is usability. The goal of the Grid Application Development Software (GrADS) project is to simplify distributed heterogeneous computing in the same way that the World Wide Web simplified information sharing over the Internet. To that end, the project is exploring the scientific and technical problems that must be solved to make it easier for ordinary scientific users to develop, execute, and tune applications on the Grid. In this paper, the authors describe the vision and strategies underlying the GrADS project, including the base software architecture for grid execution and performance monitoring, strategies and tools for construction of applications from libraries of grid-aware components, and development of innovative new science and engineering applications that can exploit these new technologies to run effectively in grid environments.",,"Distributed intelligence; Grid application development software; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Database systems; Digital libraries; Problem solving; World Wide Web; Computer aided software engineering","Aiken, R., Carey, M., Carpenter, B., Foster, I., Lynch, C., Mambretti, J., Moore, R., Teitelbaum, B., (2000) Network Policy and Services: A Report of a Workshop on Middleware, , http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2768.txt, IETF RFC 2768; Allen, G., Angulo, D., Foster, I., Lanfermann, G., Liu, C., Radke, T., Seidel, E., Shalf, J., The cactus worm: Experiments with dynamic resource discovery and allocation in a grid environment (2001) International Journal of High Performance Computer Applications, 15, pp. 345-358; Allen, G., Benger, W., Goodale, T., Hege, H., Lanfermann, G., Merzky, A., Radke, T., Seidel, E., The cactus code: A problem solving environment for the grid (2000) Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing, pp. 253-260. , Pittsburgh, PA: IEEE Computer Society Press; Anderson, E., Bai, Z., Bischof, C., Blackford, S., Demmel, J., Dongarra, J., Du Croz, J., Sorensen, D., (1999) LAPACK Users' Guide. 3rd Ed., , Philadelphia: SIAM; Balay, S., Gropp, W.D., McInnes, L.C., Smith, B.F., (2001) PETSc Users' Manual, , Technical Report ANL-95/11, Revision 2.1.0, Argonne National Laboratory; Blackford, L., Choi, J., Cleary, A., D'Azevedo, E., Demmel, J., Dhillon, I., Dongarra, J., Whaley, R., (1997) ScaLAPACK Users' Guide, , Philadelphia: SIAM; Casanova, H., Dongarra, J., NetSolve: A network-enabled server for solving computational science problems (1997) International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 11, pp. 212-223; Casanova, H., Dongarra, J., Johnson, C., Miller, M., Application-specific tools (1999) The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure, pp. 159-180. , edited by I.

In a digital library, however, the goal is to not involve people, and so queries which eliminate precision problems in query results are in demand as a replacement for the librarian. In current retrieval systems, precision is improved by using a hierarchical method such as synonym notation processing. In methods based on word systems, processing to handle the inadequate expression of the intention of a query or the semantic interpretation of a query are insufficient, and information retrieval from a more hierarchical perspective is needed. In this paper the authors propose a retrieval method using a hierarchical perspective based on a system of concepts, and not a retrieval method based on conventional word systems. By adopting the EDR electronic dictionary as a thesaurus and using concept information, queries and words which appear in papers are not processed merely as character strings, but are used in queries with consideration for the meaning of the words. The authors' method can estimate imprecise information in the intentions of queries and the meaning hidden in words, allowing for appropriate query results to be provided to users without the cooperation of a librarian.","Concept paths; Digital library; Index words; Information retrieval; Query","Computer simulation; Data structures; Digital libraries; Feature extraction; Indexing (of information); Optical character recognition; Query languages; Semantics; Thesauri; Concept paths; Electronic dictionary; Index words; Information retrieval","(1997) NAIST Electronic Library Report, '97, , http://dlw3.aist-nara.ac.jp, The Electronic Library at the Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology; Graduate School, Nara Institute of Science and Technology; Morobashi, M., Tsutsui, Y., Maruyama, H., Nomiyama, H., A proposal for effective navigation functions in an information retrieval system (1994) Digital Library Workshop, (2), pp. 45-49. , Nov; Lim, C., Chen, H., An automatic indexing and neural network approach to concept retrieval and classification of multilingual (Chinese-English) documents (1994) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern; Salton, G., Allen, J., Buckley, C., Automatic structuring and retrieval of large text files (1994) Commun ACM, 37, pp. 94-108; Yokoi, T., Kimura, K., Koizumi, A., Mitsuyoshi, H., Information structure in an electronic dictionary in hierarchical levels (1996) Trans Inf Process Soc, 37, pp. 333-343. , (in Japanese); Gorden, M., Probabilistic and genetic algorithms for document retrieval (1988) Commun ACM, 31, pp. 1208-1218; Allean, J., Relevance feedback with too much data (1995) 18th ACM SIGIR Conference on Information Retrieval, pp. 337-343; Xu, J., Croft, W.B., Query expansion using local and global document analysis (1996) 19th Annual Int ACM SIGIR Conf on R&D in Information Retrieval, pp. 4-11; Harter, S.P., A probabilistic approach to automatic keyword indexing.

Dissertations that consist of a number of articles that have already been published in or submitted to scholarly journals posed a potentional problem with regard to copyright questions. In order to solve this problem, the commersial publishers were approached with a request for permission to publish the articles electronically as a part of the doctoral dissertation. The experience from this attempt shows that from the publishers' perspective, electronic publishing is often perceived of as a threat, since the publishers 'fear they will loose the control over the material. The authors often hesitate to ask their publisher's permission because they are afraid it may put future academic publishing at risk. A negotiable factor when it comes to copyright seems to be the amount of time that passes between the first publishing of the article and the electronic publishing of the doctoral dissertation. The time factor is valuable in the negotiation between the author and the publisher, since this aspect seems to reduce the uncertainties of electronic publishing for the publisher as well as for the author.",,"Copyrights; Digital libraries; Electronic commerce; Electronic publishing; Information retrieval; Libraries; Professional aspects; Project management; Commercial publishers; Dissertations; Negotiable factors; Scholarly journals; Information technology","Björklund, C., (1998) Elektronisk Fulltextpublicering.

This article summarises the literature review and looks at what LIS commentators have to say about institutional culture, organisational structures and management styles, leadership communications, staff attributes and individual attitudes, staff training and development, in the context of developing electronic and digital library services. The author is convinced of the value of a more rigorous application of organisational and management theory to the problems and complexities of the LIS sector, as ICT innovations are breaking down older structures.

They face differences in contents, structures, spatial reference systems, semantics, interfaces, etc. In addition, these GDLs usually do not provide on-line support for the users who want to select the best products according to his needs. Our solution to these problems is to import some metadata from these GDLs, to process their data and to integrate the results in an homogeneous spatial data warehouse which serves as a 'one-stop' query engine. Such solution is known in computer sciences as 'data warehousing' and is theoretically very promising. However, there was a high level of uncertainty with regard to such a solution: conceptually, operationally and technically. Consequently, we started a research and development project to further study these theoretical possibilities and to experiment the resulting concepts. This resulted in a prototype called SOSSD (System for the Optimal Selection of Spatial Data) developed by the main author for his M.Sc., with the two co-authors as advisors. This paper presents our theoretical approach as well as the results obtained with SOSSD, including the implementation of a spatial data warehouse on the Web and the use of 'fuzzy logic' to support the users in their queries.",,"digital library; Internet","http://www.anzlic.org.au/, Norme ANZLICBédard, Y., Larrivée, S., Proulx, M.J., Caron, R.-Y., Létourneau, F., Lam, S., (1997) Geospatial Data Warehousing : Positionnement Technologique et Stratégique, 79p. , Centre de recherche en géomatique.

It seems that such a networking environment could play an important role from an informative and educational point of view. Actually, by using computer networks, it is feasible to realize a virtual classroom to offer remote students full and interactive participation in a class that would previously have been restricted to students who were attending locally [2]. In this paper the authors present a WWW student-centered educational environment that has been realized using a particular methodology which allows students to be inside an informative area. In this area they are able to focus on the topics they prefer, to satisfy their particular instructional needs and also to create an educational and engaging path, through a specific set of tools. A Mosaic sensitive map makes it possible to start the navigation in the organized cyberspace, by choosing one of the displayed topics. After choosing the topic in which the students are interested, they have a set of tools by which it is possible to access the following functionalities: 1. (a) virtual classroom; 2. (b) digital libraries and museums; 3. (c) attending to seminars and conferences; 4. (d) doing cooperative work. This set of tools can be different according to the chosen topic. © 1995.","Computer-supported cooperative work; Digital library; Educational environment; Virtual classroom","Computer aided instruction; Computer aided software engineering; Database systems; Education computing; Information dissemination; Information retrieval systems; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Computer supported cooperative work; Digital libraries and museums; Educational environment; Mosaic sensitive map; Virtual classroom; Computer networks",,Article,Scopus
