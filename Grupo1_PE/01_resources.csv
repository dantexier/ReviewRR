"Zainab A.N., Chong C.Y., Chaw L.T.","Moving a repository of scholarly content to a cloud",2013,"Library Hi Tech",31,2,,201,215,,1,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84879922863&partnerID=40&md5=40beca95344ea1aef2502491b283afca","Purpose: This paper aims to describe the problems faced by MyAIS, an open access repository of scholarly content, the reasons for moving to a cloud infrastructure and the design of the system. Design/methodology/approach: MyAIS is supported by an IBM HS22V multiple blade server using virtualization technology. A single blade server runs both MyAIS's back-end that handles the processing of digital repository and front-end that handles the web server. The whole system runs on a Linux platform. The virtualized servers deliver an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Malaya researchers as well as students. Findings: Sharing resources in the cloud cuts maintenance cost and leaves a smaller carbon footprint due to its modular design. Virtualization makes it easy to monitor access traffic and usage of hardware resources on-the-fly. The scalability and expansion of MyAIS is improved. It allows for faster system recovery in case of hard disk failure and speedy file move during migration. Larger bandwidth improves reliability and management of bottlenecks. Research limitations/implications: There are still bottlenecks at the wide area network level resulting in sluggishness during peak hours. Practical implications: There is significant improvement in storage expansion through shared hardware resources. Originality/value: Cloud as an IaaS helps reduce the total cost of ownership and maintenance, increase system scalability to handle increased traffic, meet increasing demand for storage space for full text resources, and reduce downtime. It makes backup and disaster recovery easier. It is possible to accommodate other university repositories in future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cloud computing; Digital libraries; Information systems; MyAIS; Open access repositories",,"Abrizah, A., Noorhidawati, A., Kiran, K., Global visibility of Asian universities' open access institutional repositories (2010) Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science, 15 (3), pp. 53-73; Barham, P., Dragovic, B., Fraser, K., Hand, S., Harris, T., Ho, A., Neugebauer, R., Warfield, A., Xen and the art of virtualization (2003) Proceedings. 19th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, Bolton, Landing, NY, USA, October 19, pp. 164-177; Bird, G., Ashoughian, G., All together now: Planning for shared print archiving at Canada's Western University (2012) Collection Management, 37 (3-4), pp. 260-270; Bugnion, E., Devine, S., Rosenblum, M., Sugerman, J., Wang, E.Y., Bringing virtualization to the x86 architecture with the original VMware workstation (2012) ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), 30 (4), pp. 1-51; Burton, G., Scholarly communication must be scalable (2010) Academic Evolution, , 20, February; Buyya, R., Yeo, C.S., Venugopal, S., Broberg, J., Brandic, I., Cloud computing and emerging IT platforms: Vision, hype, and reality for delivering computing as the 5th utility (2009) Future Generation Computer Systems, 25 (6), pp. 599-616; Christensen, H., HathiTrust: A research library at web scale (2011) Library Resources & Technical Services, 55 (2), pp. 93-102; Fox, R., Library in the cloud (2009) OCLC Systems & Services, 25 (3), pp. 156-161; Galvin, D., Sun, M., Avoiding the death zone: Choosing and running a library project in the cloud (2012) Library Hi Tech, 30 (3), pp. 418-427; (2012) Google Cloud Platform, , https://cloud.google.com, Google, available at; Kennan, M.A., Kingsley, D.A., The state of the nation: A snapshot of Australian institutional repositories (2009) First Monday, 14 (2). , http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2282, available at; Kim, J., (2006) Motivating and impeding factors affecting faculty contribution to institutional repositories, , www.ils.unc.edu/tibbo/JCDL2006/Kim-JCDLWorkshop2006.pdf, paper presented at Conference 2006, Chapel Hill, NC, 11-15 June, available at; Kroski, E., Library cloud atlas: A guide to cloud computing and storage/stacking the technology (2009) Library Journal, , www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6695772.html?q=kroski, September 10, available at; Kroski, E., Stacking the tech: The Library of Congress talks digital initiatives (2009) Library Journal, , www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6675049.html?q=kroski, August 6, available at; Malpas, C., (2010) Reconfiguring Academic Collections: The Role of Shared Print Repositories, , www.minitex.umn.edu/committees/mlac/Meetings/2011/Feb2011Malpas.pdf, available at, MLAC Advisory Board, Dublin, OH; Malpas, C., (2011) Cloud Sourcing Research Collections: Managing Print in the Mass-Digitized Library Environment, , www.oclc.org/resources/research/publications/library/2011/2011-01.pdf, available at, OCLC Research, Dublin, OH; Matsuura, K., (2008) Japan's institutional repositories where did they come from and where are they headed?, , Master's thesis, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; Mitchell, E., Using cloud services for library IT infrastructure (2010) Code [4] Lib Journal, (9), pp. 1-6. , http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/2510, available at; (2009) NIST.gov - Computer Security Division - Computer Security Centre, , http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/cloud-computing/index-html, NIST, available at; Nurnberg, P.J., Leggett, J.J., McFarland, S.M., Cloud as infrastructure at the Texas Digital Library (2012) Journal of Digital Information, 13 (1). , https://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/5881, available at; Pathy, S.C., Mahapatra, R.K., Cloud computing: Academic library in Orissa (2012) VSRD Technical & Non-Technical Journal, 3 (3), pp. 124-130; van Westrieneen, G., Lynch, C.A., Academic institutional repositories: Deployment status in 13 nations as of mid 2005 (2005) D-Lib Magazine, 11. , available at: doi:10.1045/September2005-westrienen; Zainab, A.N., Adding value to an abstracting and indexing system: The case of MyAIS (2012) Malaysia, World Digital Libraries, 5 (1), pp. 19-35; Zainab, A.N., Open access repositories and journals for visibility: Implications for Malaysian libraries (2010) Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science, 15 (3), pp. 97-119; Zuber, P.A., A study of institutional repository holdings by academic discipline (2008) DLib Magazine, 14 (11-12). , www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/11contents.html, available at",Article,Scopus
"Anaraki L.N., Babalhavaeji F.","Investigating the awareness and ability of medical students in using electronic resources of the integrated digital library portal of Iran: A comparative study",2013,"Electronic Library",31,1,,70,83,,,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84874120440&partnerID=40&md5=a6edc636d6ec5fbc3dfbd55bb845451d","Purpose - The present paper aims to compare the awareness and ability of medical students in using the electronic resources of the Integrated Digital Library (IDL) portal of Iran. Design/methodology/approach - The current research involves a comparative applied survey. The survey was conducted through a structured questionnaire circulated among 300 medical students sampled from three major Iranian universities. A stratified random sampling method was used. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, average and so on) have been used to analyze the data using the Microsoft Excel software. Findings - The awareness and utilization level of students in the three universities were lower than the average and those who are not aware of the existence of the IDL portal used general search engines to meet their information needs. The respondents admitted that their lack of awareness about the IDL was their most significant problem. Among the investigated universities, students of Tehran University of Medical Science (TUMS) used the End Note, Elsevier, Thomson, Scopus and Proquest databases most. All the students expressed the effect of the IDL on the academic activities as much as 64 percent in Iran University of Medical Science (IUMS), 72 percent in Tehran University of Medical Science (TUMS) and 66 percent in Shahid Beheshti Medical University (SBMU). The mean scores for utilization of searching strategies were 2.43, 2.89 and 2.87, respectively, for IUMS, TUMS and SBMU. Originality/value - A few attempts have been made to investigate the awareness, use and research ability of students in universities but this is the first of its kind to compare universities within the Integrated Digital Library. The paper will be useful for those in decision-making roles and provides insight for the people responsible for IT application. It is hoped that this paper will assist administrators of the university libraries in developing a more complete understanding of students' electronic information needs and barriers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Awareness;

The full usage of digital libraries will be realized only when people can have access to the material from any location. The advantage of multimedia is that people of all ages can understand more clearly by seeing or hearing rather than reading. Considering the exponential growth in various technologies, developing a multimedia digital library in wireless is not an complicated task. Grid computing enables the virtualization data resources, process network bandwidth and storage capacities to create a single system image granting the user a seamless access to vast IT capabilities. By adopting peer-to-peer overlay networks, which are taking a central position in information systems, the storage space problem can be solved and by using grid computing the security can be maintained. In this article, we propose a framework for wireless multimedia digital library, built using Grid and P2P technology. Using this proposed framework, the digital data is stored in a cluster built of commodity components and users can access those data from anywhere, anytime securely. Advantages of this framework are: (i) existing capital investments are used for storing the multimedia files, (ii) increased access to data, (iii) balancing workloads among different systems connected in pGrid nodes, (iv) authenticated and secured transfer of files. Benchmarks used to test this framework are: (i) file size vs. download time, (ii) simultaneous connections, (iii) band-width utilization, (iv) security, (v) scalability, and (vi) robustness. © 2012 Arulanandam et al; licensee Springer licensee InTech.","Digital library; Grid computing; Multimedia data; Peer-to-peer networks; Wireless networks","Band-width utilization; Capital investment; Commodity components; Data resources; Digital datas; Download time; Exponential growth; File sizes; IT Capabilities; Multimedia data; Multimedia files; Peer-to-peer overlay networks; Process networks; Single system image; Storage capacity; Storage spaces; Virtualizations; Wireless multimedia; Audition; Digital storage; Grid computing; Investments; Wireless networks; Digital libraries","Fei, H., Almeida, N., Loureno, M., Trezentos, P., Borbinha, J.L., Neves, J., ARCO: A long-term digital library storage system based on grid computational infrastructure (2005) Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, 1, pp. 44-51. , Miami, USA, ISBN:972-8865-19-8; Foster, I., The anatomy of the Grid: Enabling scalable virtual organizations (2001) Lecture Notes in Computer Science; Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Nick, J., Tuecke, S., The physiology of the grid: Open grid services architecture for distributed system integration (2002) Article in Open Grid Service Infrastructure WG, , Global Grid Forum; Kubiatowicz, J., Bindel, D., Chen, Y., Czerwinski, S., Eaton, P., Geels, D., Gummadi, R., Zhao, B., OceanStore: An architecture for global-scale persistent storage (2000) International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS, pp. 190-201; Fox, E.A., Marchionini, G., Toward a worldwide digital library (1998) Commun.

A problem that educators face is that no review process similar to the formal adoption processes used for K-12 textbooks or the college-textbook review process exists for these types of online educational resources. However, educators need authoritative high-quality digital teaching materials. The scientific journal peer-review system offers a well-established model to adapt to the requirements of a peer review of educational materials. In this paper, we review ten review processes developed to evaluate digital geoscience educational resources and focus in detail on a rigorous iterative peer-review process recently developed by the Climate Literacy and Energy Awareness Network (CLEAN) project. This process builds upon existing efforts and emphasizes the ""curation"" of a digital collection that addresses the Essential Principles of Climate Literacy and the Energy Literacy Principles. Providing educators with thoroughly reviewed educational materials is especially important for fast changing, societally important, and sensitive areas such as climate and energy science. © 2012 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.","Climate education; Climate literacy essential principles; Digital collection; Digital library; Educational resources; Energy education; Energy literacy principles; Peer-review process","education; literacy; teaching; textbook; twenty first century","Aivazian, B.L., Geary, E., Khoo, M., Sumner, T., Ireton, S., Serving K-12 education with DWEL: Knowledge quest (2003) Journal of American Association of School Librarians, 31 (3), pp. 21-22; Arko, R.A., Ginger, K.M., Kastens, K.A., Weatherley, J., Using annotations to add value to the digital library for education (2006) D-Lib Magazine, 12 (5). , http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may06/arko/05arko.html#Top, Available at, accessed 2 May 2012; Bangay, C., Blum, N., Education response to climate change and quality: Two parts of the same agenda?

Ontology is playing an increasingly important role in knowledge management and the semantic web. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems provide shared access to resources that are spread over the network. To address the problem of modularity, fl exibility and scalability in distributed P2P, semantic enhanced hierarchical P2P is determined to be better. In this paper, the semantic analysis mechanism is enhanced with a fuzzy document clustering scheme in a P2P distributed network, which has a capability of providing better clustering results than other clustering methods. Our experiments are conducted on 20 newsgroup data sets. The evaluation result indicates better clustering results by using the fuzzy concept with semantic distributed P2P proposed techniques.

Through the investigation carried out during the educational research project «Digital libraries », it became evident that the collections explored use a language better suited to higher education. Faced with this problem, the following question arose: What are the criteria for classifying electronic bibliographic resources for basic education? The proposed investigation was non-experimental, with a non-probabilistic sample of case studies; the sample comprised 250 resources from 10 bibliographic collections. The analysis assessed resources according to: accessibility, the curricular axis to which it is addressed, and format; pedagogical, functional, technological and aesthetic aspects. The results show a mean of 3.76, which indicates that the bibliographic collections provide quality resources, although it is necessary to improve educational and functional aspects. Classifying electronic resources for basic education requires the consideration of pedagogical needs, graphical and technological qualities and, especially, the dynamic way in which information is conceived nowadays. This confirms the need to establish a set of indicators that enable teachers to select electronic resources based on basic education curricular axes.","Accessibility; Children education; Digital information search; Digital libraries; Educational resources; Interactive learning; Teaching strategies",,"Bernhard, P., La formación en el uso de la información: Una ventaja en la enseñanza superior (2002) Situación actual.

On account of their role in the academic community, it is very important that these digital libraries collect citations in a consistent, accurate, and up-to-date manner, yet they do not correctly compile citations for myriads of authors for various reasons including authors with the same name, a problem known as the ""name ambiguity problem."" This problem occurs when multiple authors share the same name and particularly when names are simplified as in cases where names merely contain the first initial and the last name. This paper proposes a reliable and accurate pair-wise similarities approach to disambiguate names using supervised classification on Web correlations and authorship correlations. This approach makes use of Web correlations among citations assuming citations that co-refer on publication lists on the Web should to refer to the same author. This approach also makes use of authorship correlations assuming citations with the same rare author name refer to the same author, and furthermore, citations with the same full names of authors or e-mail addresses likely refer to the same author. These two types of correlations are measured in our approach using pair-wise similarity metrics. In addition, a binary classifier, as part of supervised classification, is applied to label matching pairs of citations using pair-wise similarity metrics, and these labels are then used to group citations into different clusters such that each cluster represents an individual author. Results show our approach greatly improves upon the name disambiguation accuracy and performance of other proposed approaches, especially in some name clusters with high degree of ambiguity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, this growth is accompanied by many threats. Digital content (of the e- resources) is fragile and not durable. Its accessibility and use by future generations depends on technology which very rapidly evolves and changes. Hence, ensuring access of e-resources for future generation of users is a big challenge for libraries. The present paper highlights various problems of digital content and elaborates how digital preservation is more demanding and challenging than preserving print copies of journals.

With the assumption that dentists would find the digital textbooks useful for patient care, the authors surveyed recent graduates to determine if their attitude toward the VitalSource Bookshelf had changed. A brief survey was sent to 119 alumni from the classes of 2009 and 2010 of one U.S. dental school. Forty-seven (39.5 percent) completed the questionnaire. Eighteen respondents (48.3 percent) reported using the etextbooks often or sometimes. The twenty-nine dentists who said they have not used the collection since graduation reported preferring print books or other online sources or having technical problems when downloading the books to a new computer. Only five respondents selected the VitalSource Bookshelf as a preferred source of professional information. Most of the respondents reported preferring to consult colleagues (37.8 percent), the Internet (20 percent), or hardcopy books (17.8 percent) for information. When asked in an open-ended question to state their opinion of the Bookshelf, nineteen (42.2 percent) responded positively, but almost one-third of these only liked the search feature. Six respondents reported that they never use the program. Twenty-two said they have had technical problems with the Bookshelf, including fifteen who have not been able to install it on a new computer. Many of them said they have not followed up with either the dental school or VitalSource support services to overcome this problem. Our study suggests that dentists, similar to dental students, dislike reading electronic textbooks, even with the advantage of searching a topic across more than sixty dental titles.","Computers in dentistry; Dentists; Digital libraries; E-textbooks; Educational technology; Information technology; Teaching materials",,"Strother, E.A., Brunet, D.P., Bates, M.L., Gallo III, J.R., Dental students' attitudes towards digital textbooks (2009) J Dent Educ, 73 (12), pp. 1361-1365; Brunet, D.P., Bates, M.L., Gallo III, J.R., Strother, E.A., Incoming dental students' expectations and acceptance of an electronic textbook program (2011) J Dent Educ, 75 (5), pp. 646-652; Strother, E.A., Lancaster, D.M., Gardiner, J., Information needs of practicing dentists (1986) Bull Med Libr Assoc, 74, pp. 227-230; Selvi, F., Ozerkan, A.G., Information-seeking patterns of dentists in Istanbul, Turkey (2002) J Dent Educ, 66 (8), pp. 977-980; Wardh, I., Axelsson, S., Tegelberg, A., Which evidence has an impact on dentists' willingness to change their behavior?

Design/methodology/approach - Terms are selected from the Art & Architecture Thesaurus developed by Getty Research Institute in the USA (source language) and the National Palace Museum in Taiwan participating in Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program (target language). In respect of data analysis, mapping analysis and content analysis are both adopted. Findings - Among the six types of term equivalence, ""exact equivalence"" appears most frequently. The degree of similarity between different conceptual structures can be divided into four types: similar structure, transferring part of the structure of source language into the system of target language by modeling; similar structure, but the structure of source language needs to be expanded or revised; dissimilar structure, the term in target language can be partially mapped to the term in source language; lack of structure, no matches between target language and source language. Practical implications - The next step is to develop a more comprehensive conceptual structure that can incorporate multicultural perspectives. If the ""partial equivalence"" terms are further identified as important concepts, the problems of non-exact equivalence terms and dissimilar conceptual structures can be solved by addressing the needs of English users in searching for Chinese art collections. Originality/value - The study serves as a pilot study applicable to the development of multilingual KOS in the domain of Chinese fine arts, building the first demonstration model for the interoperability of KOS in Chinese and English. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Arts; Classification; Digital libraries; Indexing; Languages",,"Baca, M., The Getty Vocabularies and issues in building multilingual thesauri (2009) TELDAP International Conference, Taipei; Chaplan, M.A., Mapping Laborline thesaurus terms to Library of Congress subject headings: Implications for vocabulary switching (1995) Library Quarterly, 56 (1), pp. 39-61; Chen, S.J., Chinese-language art & architecture thesaurus: Methods and issues (2009) CIDOC 2009, Santiago, 29 September; Doerr, M., Semantic problems of thesaurus mapping (2001) Journal of Digital Information, 1 (8). , http://jodi/ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v01/i08/Doerr/; Harpring, P., (2010) Art & Architecture Thesaurus: Editorial Guidelines, , www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ editorial_guidelines.html#aat, J.

However, numerous studies conducted over decades have shown that users routinely experience problems with subject access in library catalogs and databases. These problems are often due to inadequate quality of subject metadata, which is greatly influenced by complexity of subject representation. The fact that major cataloging standards (e.g., AACR2 and its predecessors) have been overlooking the importance of subject access and have not addressed subject cataloging is arguably one of the reasons behind problems in organization of subject access. The new cataloging code-Resource Description and Access (RDA)-attempts to fill this gap. Upon examination of how subject access is addressed in RDA and its underlying conceptual models that specify functional requirements for bibliographic control-FRBR, FRAD, and FRSAD-this article presents results of a study that used FRBR model as an analytical framework in examination of user search queries in a large-scale digital library. The findings of this study provide empirical data to inform the development of RDA sections that cover subject access, particularly subject entities and relationships. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bibliographic control; conceptual models; digital libraries; entity-relationship models; FRAD; FRBR; FRSAD; RDA; subject access; transaction log analysis; user searching",,"Allen, B., Cognitive research in information science: Implications for design (1991) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 26, pp. 3-37; Bates, M., The Getty end-user online searching project in the humanities: Report no. 6-Overview and conclusions (1996) College & Research Libraries, 57, pp. 514-523; Bates, M., Indexing and access for digital libraries and the Internet: Human, database, and domain factors (1998) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49 (13), pp. 1185-1205; Bates, M., Subject access in online catalogs: A design model (1986) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 37 (6), pp. 357-376; Beghtol, C., Bibliographic classification theory and text linguistics: Aboutness analysis, intertextuality and the cognitive act of classifying documents (1986) Journal of Documentation, 42 (2), pp. 84-113; Beitzel, S., Jensen, E., Chowdhury, A., Frieder, O., Grossman, D., Temporal analysis of a very large topically categorized Web query log (2007) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58 (2), pp. 166-178; Borgman, C., Why are online catalogs still hard to use?

As a result, a number of network services have compiled databases from the public resources scattered over the Internet. However, publications by different conferences and journals adopt different citation styles. It is an interesting problem to accurately extract metadata from a citation string which is formatted in one of thousands of different styles. It has attracted a great deal of attention in research in recent years. In this paper, based on the notion of sequence alignment, we present a citation parser called BibPro that extracts components of a citation string. To demonstrate the efficacy of BibPro, we conducted experiments on three benchmark data sets. The results show that BibPro achieved over 90 percent accuracy on each benchmark. Even with citations and associated metadata retrieved from the web as training data, our experiments show that BibPro still achieves a reasonable performance.","Data integration; digital libraries; information extraction; sequence alignment","Academic publications; Benchmark data; Data integration; Growing demand; information extraction; Network services; Public resources; Sequence alignments; Training data; Digital libraries; Experiments; Metadata; Alignment","Lee, D., Kang, J., Mitra, P., Giles, C.L., On, B.-W., Are your citations clean?

Design/methodology/approach: As DH is a relatively new field and practice in Mexican academia, this article is based on a case study of developing the Biblioteca Digital de Pensamiento Novohispano (Digital Library of New Hispanic Thought). This is one of the few DH at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), the largest public university in the country. Findings: It was found that there were three central problems for developing a DH project in a Mexican public university: existing technical knowledge and abilities at the UNAM will be challenged by DH projects; projects are the place to train human resources in DH methodology; and researchers need to consider different long-term infrastructure and hosting solutions, with or without using institutional infrastructure, at the same time researches need to work within the institution to establish a specific policy for research projects. Practical implications: The paper concludes that the structure, goals and products of DH projects need to be modified and expanded in order to also consider alternative goals and products such as: proposals of institutional policy, creation of infrastructure and academic and student training. DH projects must be regarded as disruptive, that is that the project needs to assume rupture as a part of the project itself. Originality/value: The experience of innovation and disruption is not necessarily the same in all fields and all institutions. This article documents for the first time the particular experiences of a public university in a developing country with DH projects. It has been found that the delay in using computers in the humanities in Mexico has led to the development of a specific paradox: a gap between institutional interest and disposition in the use of computers in humanities, and the lack of DH culture in those who have to develop the project. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital humanities; Digital libraries; Institutional support; Library projects; Mexico; Public university; Scholarly editing","Digital humanities; Institutional support; Me-xico; Public universities; Scholarly editing; Developing countries; Research; Societies and institutions; Digital libraries","Gayosso, B., Cómo se conectó México a Internet (2003) Revista Digital Universitaria, 5 (5). , 1 October; Hockey, S., The history of humanities computing (2004) A Companion to Digital Humanities, , www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/, available at (accessed 2 April 2010), Schreibman, S., Siemens, R., Unsworth, J.

The study addresses two research questions: (1) How do teachers conceptualize digital libraries, their relevance and issues relating to their integration into the curriculum? and (2) What are the teachers' perceptions of the initiative to develop a collaborative digital library for school projects? A series of interviews were carried out on six History subject teachers which provide a detailed and succinct information on their understanding of digital libraries, their knowledge and use of the Internet and digital resources, their perception of the possible impact of digital resources on teaching and learning, the benefits teachers seen in digital resources and the problems they have in using them. It also offers important insights on History subject teachers' perceptions of the initiative to develop a collaborative digital library for History projects, perception of its potential use, pointing out the conditions that facilitate its use in the classrooms. The paper also points out the relevance of digital libraries to the History curriculum which will make readers understand that using the technology is relevant to the teaching of all subjects. © SAGE Publications 2011.","collaborative resource development; digital libraries; digital readiness; History instruction; Malaysia; secondary school teachers",,"Abbas, J., Norris, C., Soloway, E., Middle school students' use of the ARTEMIS digital library (2002), ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL '02); Portland, Oregon, USA; 2002 98Abdullah, A., Zainab, A.N., Are Malaysian students ready to be authors of digital contents?

The model is suitable for constructing large-scale distributed network of public digital library services. All library resources and service distributed on the Internet can be integrated as a whole, which forms a new type of adaptive control service system supporting interlibrary collaboration and service access, as well sharing resources from different libraries.","CALIS; Cloud computing; Cloud services; Digital library","Adaptive Control; CALIS; Cloud services; Current situation; Distributed networks; Existing problems; Library resources; Library services; Service access; Adaptive control systems; Computer systems; Digital libraries; Distributed database systems; Information technology; Cloud computing","Zhang, Z., Computing clouds research on Chinese book intelligence community (2010) Journal of the National Library of China, 3 (2), pp. 73-96; Zhang, L., Primary research on the construction of the digital library Based on cloud computing (2010) Researches In Library Science, 21 (13), pp. 39-42; Zhang, C., Wang, J., Copycat of digital library in cloud era (2010) Education: Education Teaching Era Issue, 8 (4), pp. 68-69; Guan, Y., Digital library service mode based on cloud computing (2010) Inner Mongolia Science and Technology and Economy, 17 (6), pp. 156-157; Xinping, H., Cloud library idea (2010) Intelligence Theory and Practice, 6 (4), pp. 29-32; Tao, Y., Jiang, C., Discussion about the cloud computing application in digital library (2010) Journal of Library Tribune, 4 (3), pp. 81-83; Wang, C., Rational thinking of digital library information resources construction under cloud computing environment (2010) Journal of the Library Science of Sichuan, 17 (5), pp. 163-165; Zhang, N., Information resource sharing model under cloud computing environment (2010) Information Science, 10 (2), pp. 1476-1495; Zhang, W., Feng, K., Guanglin, H., Chun, H., Application and obstacles of cloud computing in library (2010) Library and Information Service, 7 (4), pp. 42-45; Wang, W., Chen, L., Clouds service platform model of CALIS digital library (2009) University Library Journal, 4 (3), pp. 13-18; Tan, D., Chen, P., Research of digital library based on cloud computing (2010) The Modern Computer, 3 (5), pp. 45-47; (2008) China's Higher Education Digital Library Technology Standards and Norms (Revision Or Supplemented Assembly), , CALLS management center, CALLS management center, China; (2004) China's Higher Education Digital Library Technology Standards and Norms, , CALLS management center, CALLS management center, China; Bandera, D., OSGi Service Platform Core Specification Release 4.1 (2007) OSGi Alliance, USA; Tsai, C., Lin, U., Information Security of Cloud Computing for Enterprises (2011) Advances In Information Sciences and Service Sciences, 3 (1), pp. 132-142; Ren, X., Chen, L., Zhang, J., Ma, X.-D., A Threshold-based Model for Privacy Protection in Cloud Computing (2011) Advances In Information Sciences and Service Sciences, 3 (3), pp. 163-168",Article,Scopus

This new concept, the wave, represents a common space where resources and users can work together. The problem arises when the number of resources and users is high, then tools for assisting the users in their information needs are necessary. In this case a fuzzy linguistic recommender system based on the Google Wave capabilities is proposed as tool for communicating researchers interested in common research lines. The system allows the creation of a common space by means a wave as a way of collaborating and exchanging ideas between several researchers interested in the same topic. In addition, the system suggests, in an automatic way, several researchers and useful resources for each wave. These recommendations are computed following several previously defined preferences and characteristics by means of fuzzy linguistic labels. Thus the system facilitates the possible collaborations between multi-disciplinar researchers and recommends complementary resources useful for the interaction. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed system, a prototype of the system has been developed and tested with several research groups from the same university achieving successful results. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

But to be useful, metadata records must be problem free. When problems are present in the metadata, resources are not correctly represented and users are not able to reap the benefits of metadata. To minimize, if not eliminate, such problems, it is essential to understand the kinds of problems that can occur inmetadata records. In this paper, problems found inmetadata records as reported in the literature are compared and analyzed. It is found that five categories of metadata problems can be identified. These are the problems of Incorrect Values, Incorrect Elements, Missing Information, Information Loss, and Inconsistent Value Representation. Given that these problems are detrimental to the services that can be provided by metadata, preventive or corrective measures need to be put in place so as to ensure that the benefits derived from using metadata balance the costs and efforts spent in the creation of metadata records. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Digital library; Dublin Core; IEEE LOM; IMLS; Metadata problems",,"Baca, M., (2008) Introduction to metadata: Pathways to digital information (3.0), , http://www.getty.edu/research/conductingresearch/standards/intrometadata/metadata.html, [Online ed.].

Such name ambiguity decreases the performance of document retrieval, Web search, information integration, and may cause confusion in other applications. Due to the same name spellings and lack of information, it is a nontrivial task to distinguish them accurately. In this article, we focus on investigating the problem in digital libraries to distinguish publications written by authors with identical names. We present an effective framework named GHOST (abbreviation for GrapHical framewOrk for name diSambiguaTion), to solve the problem systematically. We devise a novel similarity metric, and utilize only one type of attribute (i.e., coauthorship) in GHOST. Given the similarity matrix, intermediate results are grouped into clusters with a recently introduced powerful clustering algorithm called Affinity Propagation. In addition, as a complementary technique, user feedback can be used to enhance the performance. We evaluated the framework on the real DBLP and PubMed datasets, and the experimental results show that GHOST can achieve both high precision and recall. ©2011 ACM.","Clustering; Graph; Name disambiguation; Similarity","Affinity propagation; Clustering; Coauthorship; Data sets; Document Retrieval; Graph; Graph-based; High precision; Information integration; Intermediate results; Name disambiguation; Non-trivial tasks; Other applications; Similarity; Similarity matrix; Similarity metrics; User feedback; Web searches; Digital libraries; Information retrieval; World Wide Web; Clustering algorithms","Basu, S., Bilenko, M., Mooney, R.J., A probabilistic framework for semi-supervised clustering (2004) KDD-2004 - Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 59-68. , KDD-2004 - Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Bekkerman, R., Mccallum, A., Disambiguating web appearances of people in a social network (2005) Proceedings of the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW'05)., pp. 463-470; Bhattacharya, I., Getoor, L., Collective entity resolution in relational data (2007) ACM Trans.

In fact, in case of interaction among libraries, there would be the possibility of accessing valuable information globally. This paper is an attempt to identify interoperability models and also the main compnents important for implementing interoperability projects. A survey of performed projects in this field reveals that this type of activities started from 1998, and the number of such projects increased since 2003 Also a preliminary study reveals that more than 50 percent of these projects originate from US. There are, in fact, three levels of interoperability: Technical, Content, and Organizational Interoperability. Considering the fact that this research emphasizes on technical level, the findin show that most digital libraries use OAI protocol, XML, and Dublin Core metadata standard.","Digital libraries; Interoperability; Interoperability models; Protocols",,"Mehdi, A.-H., Interoperability between library software: A solution for Iranian libraries (2008) The Electronic library, 28 (5), pp. 726-734; Arlitsch, K., Jonsson, J., Aggregating distributed digital collections in the Mountain West Digital Library with the CONTENTdm™ multi-site server (2005) Library Hi Tech, 23 (2), pp. 220-232. , DOI 10.1108/07378830510605179; Arms William, Y., Hilmann, D., Lagoze, C., Krafft, D., Marisa, R., Saylor, J., Terrizzi, C., Van De Sompel, H., A spectrum of interoperability (2002) D-Lib Magazine, 8, p. 1. , www.dlib.org/dlib/january02/arms/01arms.html, accessed April 10, 2008; Brenda, B.H., Urban R, ., The Colorado digitization program: A collaboration success story (2004) Library Hi Tech, 22 (3), pp. 254-262; David, B., Ke, K.-Y., Witten, I.H., (2006) Document Level Interoperability for Collection Creators in Jcdl '06 Proceedings of The 6th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 105-106. , New York: ACM; Bell, J., Lewis, S., Using OAI-PMH and METS for exporting metadata and digital objects between repositories (2006) Program, 40 (3), pp. 268-276. , DOI 10.1108/00330330610681349; Mic, B.C., Peter, B., Manber, D.U., Schwartz, M.F., (1994) Scalable Internet Resource Discovery: Research Problems and Approaches, 37 (8), pp. 98-107. , Communications of the ACM; (2001) Digital Libraries: Future Directions for a European Research Program, , http://delosnoe.iei.pi.cnr.it/activities/researchforum/Brainstorming/ brainstorming-report.pdf, DELOS, DELOS, San Cassiano (Dolomites), accessed April 10, 2008); Ding, H., Solvberg, I., Rule-based metadata interoperation in heterogeneous digital libraries (2007) Electronic Library, 25 (2), pp. 193-206. , DOI 10.1108/02640470710741322, Metadata and Semantics for Digital Libraries; Fox Edward, A., Marchionini G, ., Toward a worldwide digital library (1998) Communications of the ACM, 41 (4), pp. 29-32; Niah, G., Ipeirotis, P.G., Gravano L, ., (2001) Sdlip + Starts = Sdarts A Protocol and Toolkit for Metasearching in JCDL'01 Proceedings of The 1st ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 207-214. , New York: ACM; Yan H, ., A RDF-based digital library system (2006) Library Hi Tech, 24 (2), pp. 234-240; Jayakanth, F., Maly, K., Zubair, M., Aswath, L., A dynamic approach to make CDS/ISIS databases interoperable over the internet using the OAI protocol (2006) Program, 40 (3), pp. 277-285. , DOI 10.1108/00330330610681358; Yi J, ., The development of the China networked digital library of thesis and dissertations (2004) Online Information Review, 28 (5), pp. 367-370; Joanne, K., Chiat N.C, ., A statewide metasearch service using OAI-PMH and Z39.50 (2005) Library Hi Tech, 23 (4), pp. 576-586; Carl, L., Van De Sompel, H., (2001) The Open Archives Initiative: Building a Low Cost Interoperability Framework in JCDL'01 Proceedings of The 1st ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 54-62. , New York: ACM; Carl, L., Krafft, D., Cornwell, T., Dushay, N., Eckstrom, D., Saylor, J., (2006) Metadata Aggregation and ""automated Digital Libraries"": A Retrospective on the NSDL Experience in JCDL '06 Proceedings of The 6th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 230-239. , New York: ACM; Zakaria, M., (1998) Contribution a La Resolution Des Problems D' interoperabilite Des Systems: Une Method de Conception Par Frameworks Orientes-Agents Logiciels, , PhD diss., Universite Laval; Mark, N., Z39.50 - A review, analysis and some thoughts on the future (2000) Library Hi Tech, 18 (2), pp. 158-165; Nelson Michael, L., Rocker, J., Harrison, T.L., (2003) OAI and NASA's Scientific and Technical Information.

Design/methodology/approach: A web vulnerability testing tool was used to analyze 80 European library sites in four countries to determine how many security vulnerabilities each had and what were the most common types of problems. Findings: Analysis results from surveying the libraries show the majority have serious security flaws in their web applications. The research shows that despite country-specific laws mandating secure sites, system librarians have not implemented appropriate measures to secure their online information systems. Research limitations/implications: Further research on library vulnerability throughout the world can be taken to educate librarians in other countries of the serious nature of protecting their systems. Practical implications: The findings serve to remind librarians of the complexity in providing a secure online environment for their patrons and that a disregard or lack of awareness of securing systems could lead to serious vulnerabilities of the patrons' personal data and systems. Lack of consumer trust may result in a decreased use of online commerce and have serious repercussions for the municipal libraries. Several concrete examples of methods to improve security are provided. Originality/value: The paper serves as a current paper on data security issues at Western European municipal library web sites. It serves as a useful summary regarding technical and managerial measures librarians can take to mitigate inadequacies in their security implementation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer protection; Data security; Digital libraries; Europe",,"Balas, J., Close the gates, lock the windows, bolt the doors: Securing library computers (2005) Computers in Libraries, 25 (3), pp. 28-30; Breeding, M., Building trust through secure web sites (2005) Computers in Libraries, 25 (6), pp. 24-26; Castro-Edwards, J., Data protection: Where are we now?

Findings: Both virtualization and cloud computing can be effective methods of optimizing hardware resources used to run digital library applications; however, system managers should not overlook the potential for security problems and management problems given the outsourced nature of the computing resources. Originality/value: The paper fills a gap in the digital library project management literature by providing an overview of the server virtualization and cloud computing models which could be applied to digital library projects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer applications; Digital libraries; File servers; Project management",,"Avery, P., Research indicates increase in cloud computing (2009) IT Business Edge, , www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/kn/blog/research-indicates-increase-in-cloud-computing/?cs=35256, August 26, available at; (2009) Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing, , www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/csaguide.pdf, Cloud Security Alliance, available at, V2.1; Farber, D., Oracle's Ellison nails cloud computing (2008) CNET News, , http://news.cnet.com/8301-13953_3-10052188-80.html, September 28, available at; (2010) Cloud Computing for Business and Society, , www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/cloudpolicy/, Microsoft Corporation, available at",Article,Scopus

The framework is comprised of three basic interactions-conversing, manipulating, and navigating-and 13 task-based interactions: animating, annotating, chunking, cloning, collecting, composing, cutting, filtering, fragmenting, probing, rearranging, repicturing, and searching. In a typical digital library, the purpose of interaction is to locate and access relevant information. In this framework, the purpose of interaction is to help people create knowledge, develop understanding, solve problems, and acquire insight from the resources in a collection. In other words, interaction can have epistemic benefits and, consequently, it can be used to leverage the epistemic potential of digital libraries. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Digital library; Epistemic action; Information visualization; Interaction; Knowledge environment",,"Crane, G., What do you do with a million books?

However, these resources have a wide variety of formats, terminologies, and concepts, which makes it difficult to find appropriate information for materials design, development, and evaluation. One solution to this problem is to integrate these resources into a computer readable concept map, called a domain ontology, which describes concepts and relationships among the concepts in materials science and engineering. This paper describes a trial that constructs a standard of metadata description using ontology language and demonstrates the validity of this construction through data exchange among heterogeneous material databases. ""Materials Ontology,"" which consists of several sub ontologies corresponding to substance, process, environment, and property, is developed using the ontology language of the Semantic Web, OWL, which enables the definition of a flexible and detailed structure of materials information. A versatile ""materials data format"" is built on the Materials Ontology as a component of the materials information platform and is applied to exchange data among three different thermal property databases, maintained by two major materials science research institutes in Japan.","Information Integration; Material Database; Materials Properties; Ontology","Computational simulation; Concept maps; Data exchange; Data format; Domain ontologies; Heterogeneous materials; Information integration; Information platform; Information resource; Material Database; Materials design; Materials science and engineering; Ontology language; Raw measurements; Science research; Sub-ontology; Thermal properties; Digital libraries; Handbooks; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Materials science; Metadata; Ontology; Semantic Web; Thermodynamic properties; Materials properties","Ashino, T., Fujita, M., Definition of web ontology for design-oriented material selection (2006) Data Science Journal, 5, pp. 52-63; Ashino, T., Oka, N., Development of information platform for data exchange between heterogeneous material data resources (2007) Proceedings of PV 2007 Conference, Ensuring the Long-term Preservation and Value Adding to Scientific and Technical Data, , Munich; Bechhofer, S., Van Harmelen, F., Hendler, J., Horrocks, I., McGuiness, D.L., Patel-Schneider, P.F., Stein, L.A., (2004), http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref, OWL Web Ontology Language Reference, W3C Recommendation 10 February 2004.

To explore the feasibility of utilizing LCSH in a digital environment, we might need to revisit its basic characteristics. The objectives of our study were to analyze LCSH in both syntactic and relational structures, to discover the structural characteristics of LCSH, and to identify problems and issues for the feasibility of LCSH as an effective subject access tool. This study reports and discusses issues raised by the syntactic and hierarchical structures of LCSH that present challenges to its use in a networked environment.

It is concerned with selection and assignment of requirements in sequences of releases such that important technical and resource constraints are fulfilled. Objectives: In this study we investigate which strategic release planning models have been proposed, their degree of empirical validation, their factors for requirements selection, and whether they are intended for a bespoke or market-driven requirements engineering context. Methods: In this systematic review a number of article sources are used, including Compendex, Inspec, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Springer Link. Studies are selected after reading titles and abstracts to decide whether the articles are peer reviewed, and relevant to the subject. Results: Twenty four strategic release planning models are found and mapped in relation to each other, and a taxonomy of requirements selection factors is constructed. Conclusions: We conclude that many models are related to each other and use similar techniques to address the release planning problem. We also conclude that several requirement selection factors are covered in the different models, but that many methods fail to address factors such as stakeholder value or internal value. Moreover, we conclude that there is a need for further empirical validation of the models in full scale industry trials. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The problem of this system is that the user profiles are provided directly by the own users and the process for acquiring user preferences is quite difficult because it requires too much user effort. In this paper we present a new fuzzy linguistic recommender system that facilitates the acquisition of the user preferences to characterize the user profiles. We allow users to provide their preferences by means of incomplete fuzzy linguistic preference relation. We include tools to manage incomplete information when the users express their preferences, and, in such a way, we show that the acquisition of the user profiles is improved. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper aims to explore the advantages and characteristics of using digital archives to support PBL and to offer suggestions that are helpful when using digital archives to support e-learning. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted the quasi-experimental design method to assign all participants into an experimental group and control group to evaluate differences in learning performance and the satisfaction of learners who use different digital resources during PBL processes. A statistical analysis scheme was employed to evaluate the learning performance of learners during PBL supported by different digital resources in terms of learning processes, PBL outcomes, and a questionnaire. Findings - The study obtained the following conclusions: learning performance and the satisfaction of learners in the experimental group during PBL processes supported by digital archival resources were superior to those of control-group learners who were supported by search engine resources; compared with search engine resources, the digital archival resources provide benefits in the learning phase, such as ""action"" (i.e. doing), in the proposed PBL mode, which has three learning phases; and compared with resources accessed through the Google search engine, PBL supported by digital archival resources should enhance searching performance and thereby increase learner willingness to use digital archives during e-learning. Practical implications - Using digital archives to support e-learning is a new trend in the library sciences field; however, few studies have developed useful learning modes for effective e-learning supported by digital archives. Evidential research related to e-learning supported by digital archives is also lacking; most studies used digital archives as digital course materials, thus ignoring the principal property of digital archives - excellent resource organization. Originality/value - The paper shows that by integrating the PBL mode with digital archives one can identify the advantages of digital archives in supporting e-learning, resulting in innovative and valuable research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0264-0473.","Archives; Digital libraries; Electronic media; Historical research; Problem based learning; Taiwan",,"Alami, M.E., Casel, N., Zampunieris, D., An architecture for e-learning system with computational intelligence (2008) The Electronic Library, 26 (3), pp. 318-328; Arms, W.Y., Blanchi, C., Overly, E.A., An architecture for information in digital libraries (1997) Technical Report, , www.dlib.org/dlib/february97/cnri/02arms1.html, UMI Order Number: february97-arms, Corporation for National Research Initiatives, available at:, accessed September 3; Baghaei, N., Mitrovic, T., Irwin, W., Supporting collaborative learning and problem solving in a constraint-based CSCL environment for UML class diagrams (2007) International Journal of Computer-supported Collaborative Learning, 2 (2-3), pp. 159-190; Beiers, H., Information architecture's potential contribution to an asynchronous learning environment (2000) International Workshop on Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 253-254. , RMIT University, Melbourne; Chen, M.P., Yen, J.C., Exploring the effects of design perspective on web-based learning performance (2003) Paper Presented at the ED-MEDIA 2003-World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications, , Honolulu, HI, June 23-28; Chu, H.C., Hwang, G.J., Huang, S.X., Wu, T.T., A knowledge engineering approach to developing e-libraries for mobile learning (2008) The Electronic Library, 26 (3), pp. 303-317; Dalgarno, B., Interpretations of constructivism and consequences for Computer Assisted Learning (2001) British Journal of Educational Technology, 32 (2), pp. 183-194; Dillon, A., Turnbull, D., Information architecture (2005) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, , Marcel Dekker, New York, NY; Dong, A., Agogino, A.M., Design principles for the information architecture of a SMET education digital library (2001) 1st ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL'01), pp. 314-321; Ferguson, C.D., Bunge, C.A., The shape of services to come: Value-based reference service for the largely digital library (1997) College Research Libraries, 58 (3), pp. 253-255; Fuchs, M., Muscogiuri, C., Niederée, C., Hemmje, M., Digital libraries in knowledge management: An e-learning case study (2004) International Journal on Digital Libraries, 4 (1), pp. 31-35; Goh, D.H., Ang, R.P., Theng, Y.L., Lim, E.P., GeogDL: A web-based approach to geography examination revision (2005) Computers & Education, 45 (1), pp. 57-73; Isaksen, S.G., Treffinger, D.J., Dorval, K.B., (2000) Creative Approaches to Problem Solving: A Framework for Change, , 2nd ed., Creative Problem Solving Group, Buffalo, Williamsville, NY; Kuhlthau, C.C., Learning in Digital Libraries: An Information Search Process Approach (1997) Library Trends, 45 (4), pp. 708-724. , Children and the Digital Library; Leazer, G.H., Gilliland-Swetland, A.J., Borgman, C.L., Evaluating the use of a geographic digital library in undergraduate classrooms: ADEPT (2000) Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 248-249. , San Antonio, Texas, June 2-7; Lynch, C., (1995) CNI white paper on networked information discovery and retrieval, , www.cni.org/projects/nidr, available at; Marchionini, G., Maurer, H., The roles of digital libraries in teaching and learning (1995) Communications of the ACM, 38 (4), pp. 67-75; Marshall, B.B., Chen, H., Shen, R., Fox, E.A., Moving digital libraries into the student learning space: The GetSmart experience (2006) ACM Journal of Educational Resources in Computing, 2 (1), pp. 1-20; Mishra, S., A design framework for online learning environments (2002) British Journal of Educational Technology, 33 (4), pp. 493-496; Oldenettel, F., Malachinski, M., Reil, D., Integrating digital libraries into learning environments: The LEBONED approach (2003) International Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 280-290. , Houston, TX, 27-31 May; Peters, M., Cybernetics, cyberspace, and the politics of university reform (1996) Australian Journal of Education, 40 (2), pp. 162-176; Russell, K., (1998) CEDARS: Long-term Access and Usability of Digital Resources - The Digital Preservation Conundrum, , www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue18/cedars, Ariadne, No. 18, available at:, accessed September 1; Saeed, R.S., How digital libraries can support e-learning (2006) The Electronic Library, 24 (3), pp. 389-401; Savery, J.R., Duffy, T.M., Problem-based learning: An instructional model and its constructivist framework (1996) Constructivist Learning Environments: Case Studies in Instructional Design, pp. 135-148. , Wilson, B.

Design/methodology/approach - Four librarians in charge of the management of digital library resources were interviewed regarding student-users' problematic copyright-infringement behaviors that these librarians often encountered when they promoted the use of digital library resources. Also, a semi-structured questionnaire with nine questions about copyright-related behaviors was developed and distributed to college students. Students needed not only to identify whether the behavior was acceptable, but also to explain the reasons for their identification. A total of 109 valid sets of data were collected from 18 universities or colleges, the sets comprising responses from 48 undergraduate, 56 postgraduate, and five doctoral students. Findings - The librarian-interview results indicate that students' problematic behaviors included systematic downloading, distribution to unauthorized users, and going beyond the purpose and character of academic use. The student-survey results indicate that students had four major areas of misunderstanding about copyright laws when using digital library resources: the digital resources should be shared; the downloaded digital resources are all legitimately authorized and permitted; all educational use is fair use; and any downloading is permitted as long as students are paying tuition. Originality/value - This paper explores students' understanding and misunderstandings that arose when students used the school digital library resources and discusses implications of these results for librarians and libraries with regard to the design of related instruction. The paper also presents interpretations of students' thoughts and conduct, as well as some future possible research topics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0264-0473.","Colleges; Copyright law; Digital libraries; Resources; Students; Taiwan",,"Chou, C., Chan, P.-S., Wu, H.-C., Using a two-tier test to assess students' understanding and alternative conceptions of cyber copyright laws (2007) British Journal of Educational Technology, 38 (6), pp. 1072-1084. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00695.x; Chou, C., Tsai, C.C., Chan, P.S., Developing a web-based two-tier test for internet literacy (2007) British Journal of Educational Technology, 38 (2), pp. 369-372; Fernández-Molina, J.C., Guimarães, J.A.C., The WIPO development agenda and the contribution of the international library community (2009) The Electronic Library, 27 (6), pp. 1010-1025; Godwin, W., Wild, wild web (2000) Cyberethics: Social and Moral Issues in the Computer Age, pp. 215-221. , Baird, R.

The purpose of this paper is to report on the work to develop a national repository for course syllabi in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes a prototype syllabus repository system for higher education in Ireland,which has been developed by utilising a number of information extraction and document classification techniques, including a new fully unsupervised document classification method that uses a web search engine for automatic collection of training set for the classification algorithm. Findings - Preliminary experimental results for evaluating the performance of the system and its various units, particularly the information extractor and the classifier, are presented and discussed. Originality/value - In this paper, three major obstacles associated with creating a large-scale syllabus repository are identified, and a comprehensive review of published research work related to addressing these problems is provided. Two different types of syllabus documents are identified and describe a rule-based information extraction system capable of extracting structured information from unstructured syllabus documents is described. Finally, the importance of classifying resources in a syllabus digital library is highlighted, a number of standard education classification schemes are introduced, and the unsupervised automated document classification system, which classifies syllabus documents based on an extended version of the International Standard Classification of Education, is described. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries;

"Mehler A., Waltinger U.","Enhancing document modeling by means of open topic models: Crossing the frontier of classification schemes in digital libraries by example of the DDC",2009,"Library Hi Tech",27,4,,520,539,,3,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72049116355&partnerID=40&md5=5128774ace887262199e504fe24da414","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a topic classification model using the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) as the target scheme. This is to be done by exploring metadata as provided by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) to derive document snippets as minimal document representations. The reason is to reduce the effort of document processing in digital libraries. Further, the paper seeks to perform feature selection and extension by means of social ontologies and related web-based lexical resources. This is done to provide reliable topic-related classifications while circumventing the problem of data sparseness. Finally, the paper aims to evaluate the model by means of two language-specific corpora. The paper bridges digital libraries, on the one hand, and computational linguistics, on the other. The aim is to make accessible computational linguistic methods to provide thematic classifications in digital libraries based on closed topic models such as the DDC. Design/methodology/approach: The approach takes the form of text classification, text-technology, computational linguistics, computational semantics, and social semantics. Findings: It is shown that SVM-based classifiers perform best by exploring certain selections of OAI document metadata. Research limitations/implications: The findings show that it is necessary to further develop SVM-based DDC-classifiers by using larger training sets possibly for more than two languages in order to get better F-measure values. Originality/value: Algorithmic and formal-mathematical information is provided on how to build DDC-classifiers for digital libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Document management; Modelling",,"Biber, D., (1995) Dimensions of Register Variation: A Cross-Linguistic Comparison, , Cambridge University Press; Bickhard, M.H., Social ontology as convention (2008) Topoi, 27 (1-2), pp. 139-149; Cilibrasi, R.L., Vitanyi, P.M.B., The Google similarity distance (2007) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 19 (3), pp. 370-383; Cramer, I., How well do semantic relatedness measures perform?

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of digitisation surveys were performed. Analysis concentrated on several themes: general methodological solutions, digitisation objectives, users and usage of digitised content, budgeting and costs of digitisation, and volume and growth of digitised collections. Findings: Analysis revealed an absence of sound methodology solutions, issues of constructing a sample, the split between strategic and resource management approaches to digitisation, low visibility of user related evaluation criteria, and problems in developing quantitative measures. Research limitations/implications: Approaches to evaluating digitisation are not restricted to digitisation surveys and to provide a more comprehensive analysis these should be complemented by other data (e.g. interviews of digitisation experts). The identification of surveys was limited by subjective factors such as knowledge of national experts, visibility of reports on the web, and language of publication. Practical implications: The paper assists in the development of digitisation surveys by highlighting previous gaps and achievements. Originality/value: The paper is a first attempt to comprehend approaches to monitoring digitisation internationally. Gaps and issues identified in the research can guide studies on developing indicators and measures for specific digitisation activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Europe; European Union; Resource management",,"(2004) A Guide to European Group on Museum Statistics, , www.smb.spk-berlin.de/ifm/dokumente/materialien/IfM_001-202_WEB.pdf, European Group on Museum Statistics, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); (2003) ASERL Survey of Member Digitization Activities/Collections, , www.aserl.org/projects/digitization/ASERL_Digitization_Survey-Digitization_Mgrs.pdf, ASERL, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); Astle, P.J., Muir, A., Digitization and preservation in public libraries and archives (2002) Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 34 (2), pp. 67-79; Bazerman, C., Prior, P., (2004) What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Text and Textual Practices, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ and London; Besser, H., Digital image distribution: A study of costs and uses (1999) D-Lib Magazine, 5 (10). , www.dlib.org/dlib/october99/10besser.html, available at, (accessed 26 June 2008); Besser, H., (2003) Introduction to Imaging: Revised Version, , www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/introimages/, available at, (accessed 1 October 2008); Buckland, M., Information as thing (1991) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 42 (5), pp. 351-60; Bultmann, B., Hardy, R., Muir, A., Wictor, C., (2005) Digitised Content in the UK Research Library and Archives Sector, , www.jisc.ac.uk/uploaded_documents/JISC-Digi-in-UK-FULL-v1-final.pdf, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); (2008) Canadian Heritage Information Network, , www.chin.gc.ca/English/index.html, Canadian Heritage Information Network, available at, (accessed 1 October 2008); Cathro, W., Digitization in Australasia (2007) The Journal for the Serials Community, 20 (1), pp. 9-15; (2005) I2010: Digital Libraries, , http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/communication/en_comm_digital_libraries.pdf, Commission of the European Communities, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Commission of The European Communities, Belgium, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); (2003) Moving Theory into Practice: Digital Imaging Tutorial, , www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/tutorial/contents.html, Cornell, available at:, (accessed 1 October 2008); Coyle, K., Mass digitization of books (2006) The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 32 (6), pp. 641-5; Learning objects from cultural and scientific heritage resources (2003) DigiCULT, , www.digicult.info/downloads/digicult_thematicissue4_hres.pdf, DigiCULT, No. 4, available, (accessed 1 October 2008); Virtual communities and collaboration in the heritage sector (2004) DigiCULT, , www.digicult.info/downloads/digicult_thematicissue5_january_2004.pdf, DigiCULT, No. 5, available at:, (accessed 1 October 2008); (2008) Digital Libraries Initiative: Cultural Heritage, , http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/cultural/index_en.htm, Digital Libraries Initiative, available at:, (accessed 1 October 2008); (2006) DLF-Aquifer Services Institutional Survey Report: Aquifer Services Working Group Report on the Institutional User-Services Survey Results, , www.diglib.org/aquifer/SWGisrfinal.pdf, DLF-Aquifer Services, available at:, (accessed 26 June 2008); Dorner, D.D., Chawner, B., Searle, S., (2002) Creating a Digital Babylon?

The study also highlights the problems that are confronted by the female students in completing their research work after limited access to digital library in the female campus of the University. Design methodology: Survey was administered personally to collect data from 315 female students of eight faculties of the female campus of the university. The convenient sampling technique was used to collect data from the subjects of the study. Findings: The access to digital library is indispensable to the students to complete their research work. With limited access to the digital library the students were unable to meet their information needs from the Internet and the libraries of other universities. The quantity as well as quality of their research work were affected due the restriction of digital resources. Also the limited access affected adversely to improve insight of the respondents regarding technological developments in their respective area of research. The lack of informational literacy program, IT training workshops, IT literate staff and the electricity failure were the main hindrance to access digital library as well as Internet. Research limitation: This study was limited only to female students of the International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

More and more calligraphy works are digitized, preserved and exhibited in digital libraries. Users may want to appreciate the style-similar works simultaneously. However, currently available services such as metadata-based browsing and searching can not satisfy such kind of requirement. To allow users to appreciate the style-similar works conveniently, we propose a Supervised Learning Weighted Random Walk Model to discover calligraphy style relationships. In the model, we consider the heterogeneity of both edges and nodes, and then use some preference pairs to learn the weights of different types of edges in the graph. After the weight learning, the style relationships can be discovered by random walk on the heterogeneous graphs. In order to solve the out-of-graph node problem, we pre-compute the personalized vector for each character or visual word, then utilize the Linearity Theory for vector addition to approximate the relationships between the new node and other nodes in graph. Then we demonstrate several applications which prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model and a user study for benefit verification. Finally, we explore some strategies to enhance the performance with the explicit or implicit user interaction including feedback, clickthrough data tracking. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Chinese calligraphy; Feedback; Random walk; Style relationships discovery; Weight learning","Chinese calligraphy; Clickthrough data; Heterogeneous graph; Random walk; Random walk models; Style relationships discovery; User interaction; User study; Vector addition; Visual word; Weight learning; Digital libraries; Education; Metadata; Supervised learning; Graph theory","Agarwal, A., Chakrabarti, S., Learning random walks to rank nodes in graphs (2007) ICML'07: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 9-16. , ACM, New York; Agarwal, A., Chakrabarti, S., Aggarwal, S., Learning to rank networked entities (2006) KDD'06: Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 14-23. , ACM, New York; Chakrabarti, S., Agarwal, A., Learning parameters in entity relationship graphs from ranking preferences (2006) PKDD.

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was designed on the basis of the definition and features of digital libraries, together with the relevant library homepages and services. Overall, ten comprehensive universities and their library web sites, five public libraries and one science library were selected for comparison and analysis focusing on the content set-up, digital resources, navigation systems, mainstream modes, home-grown databases construction, user instruction training programs etc. Other issues including the virtual reference, service (VRS), academic information resource portal and integrated searching system or platform, personalized service, logon and authentication are also discussed. Findings - All the selected libraries are operational digital libraries or prototypes. The electronic or digital resources are made up of two parts and the mainstream modes are service-oriented. Most have their own library information portals and provided integrated searching. However, there are some defects in term unification on some home pages, unified retrieval platform selection among various databases, and navigation system construction. Practical implications - This paper presents a perspective of how DLs in China have been developing in the past few years. It also indicates the existing problems and difficulties and suggests the practical ways to optimize the application, standards, laws and rules, personal information environment, logon and authentication based on encryption. In addition, Open Access resources' utilization, conflict between copyright protection and resources sharing, and user interface customizing are addressed. Originality/value - This paper describes the general status of Chinese digital library construction. It provides relevance for researchers and the public in China as well as other countries on the DL construction experiences, efforts and achievements. It also highlights the importance and value of sharing experience in DL construction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Digital libraries; Resource management; User interfaces",,"Brantley, S., Armstrong, A., Lewis, K.M., ""Usability testing of a customizable library web portal"" (2006) College and Research Libraries, 67 (2), pp. 146-163; (2006) ""China Academic Library & Information System"", , www.calis.edu.cn, China Academic Library & Information System available at: (accessed 18 September 2006); (2006) ""The Navigation of Net Resources of Key Disciplines"", , www.calis.edu.cn/calisnew/calis_index.asp?fid=3&class=6, China Academic Library & Information System available at: (accessed 18 September 2006); (2007) ""China-US Million Book Digital Library Project"", , www.cadal.net, China-America Digital Academic Library available at: (accessed 6 September 2007); (2006) ""Chinese National Science Digital Library"", , www.csdl.net.cn/, Chinese National Science Digital Library available at: (accessed 16 September 2006); Cohen, S., Fereira, J., Horne, A., Kibbee, B., ""MyLibrary: Personalized electronic services in the Cornell University Library"" (2000) D-Lib Magazine, 6 (4), pp. 5-7; (2007) ""Fudan University Library"", , www.library.fudan.edu.cn/, Fudan University Library available at: (accessed 6 September 2007); Gambles, A., ""The headline personal information environment: Evaluation phase one"" (2001) D-Lib Magazine, 7 (3), pp. 14-16; Li, G., (2002) Digital Libraries Research, , Peking Library Publishing House, Peking; (2006) ""Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences"", , www.las.ac.cn/, Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences available at: (accessed 16 September, 2006); (2007) ""The Library of Renmin University of China"", , www.lib.ruc.edu.cn/, (The) Library of Renmin University of China available at: (accessed 6 September 2007); (2007) ""Library of University of Science and Technology of China"", , http://lib.ustc.edu.cn/, Library of University of Science and Technology of China available at: (accessed 6 September 2007); (2007) ""Nanjing Library"", , www.jslib.org.cn, Nanjing Library available at: (accessed 6 September 2007); (2007) ""Nanjing University Library"", , http://lib.nju.edu.cn/, Nanjing University Library available at: (accessed 6 September 2007); (2007) ""National Library of China.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploration of opposed concepts by an analytic comparison of two books which take different sides of this argument. Findings: The impact of digital information culture on librarians should be to free them from concerns about disposing of stock in order to release library space to be used for better digital communication facilities, and to avoid diverting resources into expensive building programmes designed to retain all the print items purchased by libraries over the last 50 years. Resources that in the past would have been spent on warehousing expanding collections should nowadays be spent on buying more intensively used digital content and redesigning libraries as open spaces with digital technologies which can facilitate the new learning activities associated with the electronic campus. Research limitations/implications: The underlying concepts examined in this paper are complex and could be subject to further examination and challenge through rigorous research. Practical implications: This paper offers a realistic way of dealing with everyday problems in contemporary library management.

One of the interesting substructures of such a graph is a community structure, which is a subset of nodes that are more densely linked when compared with the rest of the network. Such dense subgraphs gather individuals who share similar interests depending on the type of relation encoded in the graph. In this paper we tackle the problem of identifying communities in dynamic networks. We propose an approach based on the random walk to identify communities in evolving graphs like collaborative networks. We apply this approach to the Infocom co-authorship network to determine stable collaborations and evolving communities. We use such information, combined with other Digital Bibliography Library Project (DBLP) co-authorship network topology features, to analyse the formation of the programme committee board of a conference.

It causes the information access by the users is a complex activity and they need tools to assist them to obtain the required information. Recommender systems are tools whose objective is to evaluate and filter the great amount of information available in a specific scope to assist the users in their information access processes. Another obstacle is the great variety of representations of information, specially when the users take part in the process, so we need more flexibility in the information processing. The fuzzy linguistic modeling allows to represent and handle flexible information. Similar problems are appearing in other frameworks, such as digital academic libraries, research offices, business contacts, etc. We focus on information access processes in technology transfer offices. The aim of this paper is to develop a recommender system for research resources based on fuzzy linguistic modeling. The system helps researchers and environment companies allowing them to obtain automatically information about research resources (calls or projects) in their interest areas. It is designed using some filtering tools and a particular fuzzy linguistic modeling, called multi-granular fuzzy linguistic modeling, which is useful when we have to assess different qualitative concepts. The system is working in the University of Granada and experimental results show that it is feasible and effective. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines the implementation process along with the problems encountered and their solutions and impacts on the use of the system in the implementation of Verde ERM system at University of Windsor Leddy Library, which implemented the system as one of the early adopters within a consortium. The issues and challenges the library experienced in the project are analyzed and discussed. Findings - The ERM system is still in its early stages. There are both benefits and challenges of the consortia approach in ERM system implementation. Should a library adopt the system within a consortium or just as a single library? When would be the right time to implement an ERM system? Answers depend on the library's local needs, resources and environment. The strategy of ERM system selection, evaluation and implementation is crucial for libraries to make a suitable decision. Practical implications - The issues related to the ERM system implementation in a consortium environment discussed in the paper will have implications for libraries to select a proper approach and time on the adoption of emerging library systems. Originality/value - The paper addresses issues related to a large library system, especially ERM system implementation in a consortium environment.

This includes technical documentation of textual markup or database construction, and procedural documentation about resource construction. Design/methodology/approach - A case study is presented of an attempt to reuse electronic text to create a digital library for humanities users, as part of the UCIS project. The results of qualitative research by the LAIRAH study on provision of procedural documentation are discussed, as also is, user perception of the purpose, construction and usability of resources collected using semi-structured interviews and user workshops. Findings - In the absence of technical documentation, it was impossible to reuse text files with inconsistent markup (COCOA and XML) in a Digital Library. Also, although users require procedural documentation, about the status and completeness of sources, and selection methods, this is often difficult to locate. Practical implications - Creators of digital humanities resources should provide both technical and procedural documentation and make it easy to find, ideally from the project web site. To ensure that documentation is provided, research councils could make documentation a project deliverable. This will be even more vital once the AHDS is no longer funded to help ensure good practice in digital resource creation. Originality/value - Previous work has argued that documentation is important. However, the paper presents actual evidence of the problems caused by a lack of documentation and shows that this makes reuse of digital resources almost impossible. This is intended to persuade project creators who wish resources to be reused to provide documentation about its contents and technical specifications. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Earlier efforts in the DL area have concentrated on metadata harvesting and provisioning of value-added Federated Digital Library (FDL) services to the users. FDL services, however, have to meet significant performance and scalability requirements, which is difficult to achieve in centralized metadata harvesting systems. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the benefits of using Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) compliant grid middleware infrastructure for providing efficient and reliable FDL services. The presented FDL application allows for parallel harvesting of OAI-PMH compliant DLs. The results show that this approach efficiently solves the performance related problems, while it also contributes to greater flexibility of the system. The quality of service is improved as metadata can be updated frequently, and the system does not exhibit a single point of failure. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It provides advice on how to solve the problem of the reading habits of library users in developing countries and how rapidly needs of readers with libraries are adopting alternatives to locally held print sources in order to meet the traditional reading habits. Design/methodology/approach - Through reading and studying the related reference materials and literatures by searching in CNKI and checking web sites, the paper provides general tactics on how to develop digital libraries in developing countries. The paper first analyzes the definition and features of the digital library, and is followed by an introduction to libraries in developing countries, confronted with the problems caused by traditional reading habits. Before discussing digital resources and their applications, a brief introduction is presented to the development of digital libraries in mainland China. Findings - The functions of digital libraries in developing countries are seriously diminished due to traditional reading habits. Libraries in developing countries should offer comprehensive services and take due account of the needs of the traditional readers when developing digital libraries. For many years, documents that the library has collected have mainly been various kinds of printed materials. Printed documents are an advantage of the library for traditional users because digital documents cannot totally replace them. It is also unnecessary to digitize all the collected documents of the traditional library. As digital libraries are developed, traditional libraries must continue to provide an excellent service in meeting the needs of users with traditional reading habits. Originality/value - This paper provides some observations and insights into the design and development of digital libraries in developing countries. All of the above attracts the attention of the digital library in developing countries to the traditional users. To try to get the most appropriate architectural space, facilities and management, efficient service, comfortable environment and modern equipment to enable the libraries to offer the fastest information service for all the readers, the traditional users or modern users.","China; Developing countries; Digital libraries; Information services; Library users; Reading",,"Davis, C., ""Organizational influences on the university electronic library"" (1997) Information Processing and Management, 33 (3), pp. 377-792; Ferguson, C.D., Bunge, C.A., ""The shape of services to come: Values-based versus reference service for the largely digital library"" (1997) College & Research Libraries, 58 (3), pp. 252-265; Franklin, B., Plum, T., ""Library usage patterns in the electronic information environment"" (2004) Information Research, 9 (4). , http://informationr.net/ir/9-4/paper187.html, available at; Gould, J.D., Alfaro, L., Finn, R., Haupt, B., Minuto, A., ""Reading from CRT displays can be as fast as reading from paper"" (1987) Human Factors, 29 (5), pp. 197-199; ""Statistical analysis of the teachers' utilization of electronic information resources in Nankai University"" (2004) Tianjin Library Journal, (2), pp. 13-16. , Information Consultant Department of Nankai University Library; Jin, Y., ""Researches on utilization of electric information resources in the college libraries in Guangdong"" (2003) Library Tribune, 123 (15), pp. 81-85; McDonald, A., ""The human factors in developing electronic library services"" (1999) ICDE Librarians' Roundtable, , www.ouhk.edu.hk/10th/roundtable/uk2.pdf, Hong Kong, October 11-12, available at; Raitt, D., ""The library of the future"" (1993) Libraries and the Future: Essays on the Library in the Twenty-first Century, , in Lancaster, F.W.

With CADNA the numerical quality of any simulation program can be controlled. Furthermore by detecting all the instabilities which may occur at run time, a numerical debugging of the user code can be performed. CADNA provides new numerical types on which round-off errors can be estimated. Slight modifications are required to control a code with CADNA, mainly changes in variable declarations, input and output. This paper describes the features of the CADNA library and shows how to interpret the information it provides concerning round-off error propagation in a code. Program summary: Program title:CADNA. Catalogue identifier:AEAT_v1_0. Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEAT_v1_0.html. Program obtainable from:CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland.

No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:566 495. Distribution format:tar.gz. Programming language:Fortran. Computer:PC running LINUX with an i686 or an ia64 processor, UNIX workstations including SUN, IBM. Operating system:LINUX, UNIX. Classification:4.14, 6.5, 20. Nature of problem:A simulation program which uses floating-point arithmetic generates round-off errors, due to the rounding performed at each assignment and at each arithmetic operation. Round-off error propagation may invalidate the result of a program. The CADNA library enables one to estimate round-off error propagation in any simulation program and to detect all numerical instabilities that may occur at run time. Solution method:The CADNA library [1] implements Discrete Stochastic Arithmetic [2-4] which is based on a probabilistic model of round-off errors. The program is run several times with a random rounding mode generating different results each time. From this set of results, CADNA estimates the number of exact significant digits in the result that would have been computed with standard floating-point arithmetic. Restrictions:CADNA requires a Fortran 90 (or newer) compiler. In the program to be linked with the CADNA library, round-off errors on complex variables cannot be estimated. Furthermore array functions such as product or sum must not be used. Only the arithmetic operators and the abs, min, max and sqrt functions can be used for arrays. Running time:The version of a code which uses CADNA runs at least three times slower than its floating-point version. This cost depends on the computer architecture and can be higher if the detection of numerical instabilities is enabled. In this case, the cost may be related to the number of instabilities detected.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the heterogeneity problems to be solved. It introduces semantic web techniques that can help in solving them, focusing on the representation of controlled vocabularies and their semantic alignment. It gives pointers to some previous projects and experiments that have tried to address the problems discussed. Findings - Semantic web research provides practical technical and methodological approaches to tackle the different issues. Two contributions of interest are the simple knowledge organisation system model and automatic vocabulary alignment methods and tools. These contributions were demonstrated to be usable for enabling semantic search and navigation across collections. Research limitations/implications - The research aims at designing different representation and alignment methods for solving interoperability problems in the context of controlled subject vocabularies. Given the variety and technical richness of current research in the semantic web field, it is impossible to provide an in-depth account or an exhaustive list of references. Every aspect of the paper is, however, given one or several pointers for further reading. Originality/value - This article provides a general and practical introduction to relevant semantic web techniques. It is of specific value for the practitioners in the cultural heritage and digital library domains who are interested in applying these methods in practice.","Archives management; Digital libraries; Worldwide web",,"Antoniou, G., van Harmelen, F., (2004) Semantic Web Primer, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Balikova, M., ""Multilingual subject access to catalogues of national libraries (MSAC), Czech Republic's collaboration with Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Lithuania and Latvia"" (2005) Proceedings of the 71st IFLA General Conference and Council ""Libraries - A Voyage of Discovery"", , www.ifla.org/IV/ifla71/papers/044e-Balikova.pdf, in Oslo, Norway, 2005, available at: (accessed 18 December 2007); Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., ""The Semantic Web"" (2001) Scientific American, 284 (5), pp. 34-43. , www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00048144-10D2-1C70-84A9809EC588EF21, available at: (accessed 18 December 2007); (2004) RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema, , www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/, Brickley, D. and Guha, R.V.

Compilers provide mature frontends with robust parsers and type checkers, but solving language processing problems in general-purpose languages without transformation libraries is tedious. Reusing these frontends with existing transformation systems is therefore attractive. However, for this reuse to be optimal, the functional logic found in the frontend should be exposed to the transformation system - simple data serialization of the abstract syntax tree is not enough, since this fails to expose important compiler functionality, such as import graphs, symbol tables and the type checker. In this paper, we introduce a novel and general technique for combining term-based transformation systems with existing language frontends. The technique is presented in the context of a scriptable analysis and transformation framework for Java built on top of the Eclipse Java compiler. The framework consists of an adapter automatically extracted from the abstract syntax tree of the compiler and an interpreter for the Stratego program transformation language. The adapter allows the Stratego interpreter to rewrite directly on the compiler AST. We illustrate the applicability of our system with scripts written in Stratego that perform framework and library-specific analyses and transformations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The font layout table is a newly introduced resource that enables users to add support for drawing new scripts and languages. Font layout tables complement fonts; the knowledge required for complex text layout is stored in fonts and/or font layout tables. If a font contains, for example, ligature information, the corresponding font layout table describes the knowledge other than ligatures. A font layout table is used to convert a character code sequence into a glyph string to be displayed. It consists of rules, structured as cascaded stages, that may contain regular expressions and character categories. This combination enables flexible code sequence manipulation. In our multilingual text-processing library, the drawing module is script- and language-independent. It reads the necessary fonts and font layout tables on demand. Since font layout tables conceal the differences between font formats, the drawing module can handle fonts of different formats in a unified manner. This paper describes the problems in drawing multilingual text, several existing solutions to the problems and their drawbacks, and our solutions in detail.

Design/methodology/ approach - This study selects six digital libraries to represent a variety of digital libraries developed or sponsored by different types of organisations. The Help features of these selected digital libraries are examined by their types (explicit versus implicit), formats (texts, images, screenshots, multimedia materials, and interactive formats), and presentation styles (descriptive, guided, procedural, and exemplary). Findings - This study presents the types of Help features available in the selected digital libraries, and further characterises the formats and presentation styles of these Help features. In the process of analysis, the author also identifies six types of problems: lack of standards; tradeoff between using explicit Help and implicit help; tradeoff between using general Help versus specific Help; lack of interactive Help features; lack of dynamic presentation styles; and lack of Help features for advanced users and users who do not understand English. Research limitations/implications - In order to design Help features that facilitate users to effectively use digital libraries, further research needs to extend studies to what types of help-seeking situations users generally encounter and the corresponding support they need. Originality/value - This study provides insightful information regarding the current status and problems of the Help features in existing digital libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Information retrieval; Problem solving","Data reduction; Information retrieval; Problem solving; Societies and institutions; Standards; User interfaces; Dynamic presentation; Formats; Presentation styles; Digital libraries","Connell, T.H., Subject searching in online catalogs: Metaknowledge used by experienced searchers (1995) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 46 (7), pp. 506-18; Cool, C., Xie, H., How can IR help mechanism be more helpful to users?

This phenomenon is also occurring in the academic information resource market of Korea. As a result, it is necessary to positively review linking library services with search portals. In particular, a plan to link the services of university libraries (which are recognized as private facilities of universities) is needed, utilizing them actively as public facilities connected with the local community. In this context, this study discusses a model to link the Korean University Library OPAC with search portals. Design/methodology/approach - Analyzes the present status of cases in foreign countries - already vigorously active - and raise several points. In consideration of analysis, sets basic directions about linking library OPAC to search portals. Proposes a detailed model to link search portals with University Library Union Catalogs and manifestation of Deeplink to local University Library OPAC in consideration of technical situation of Korean Library OPACs. Findings - A major problem from established cases is that portal search engines cover all areas so retrieval results are generally vast. Users cannot easily find a path accessing library resources through search portals without special equipment. Originality/value - This paper proposes models to link library catalogs through special sub domains or book services of portal sites using University Library Union Catalogs as a gateway. It also proposes three alternatives of Deeplink implementation to local OPACs.","Online catalogues; Portals; South Korea; University libraries","Information services; Internet; Online systems; Portals; Search engines; Library services; Search portal; Digital libraries","Lee, J., Park, S., ""Trend and development direction of search portal system"" (2005) Information Management Study, 36 (4), pp. 71-89; (2006), www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/facts/default.htm, OCLC WorldCat (2006) available at:Song, Y., Kim, U., Kim, Y., ""Linking private portals of national knowledge information resource using web service"" (2006) 2005 Spring Conference of the Korea Society of Management Information Systems, , Seoul, Korea, 17 June 2006, Korea Science and Technology Hall; Wang, A.H., ""OCLC Open WorldCat Program"" (2006) OCLC Open WorldCat Presentation, , Seoul, Korea, 10 April 2006, Korea Education and Research Information Service; Yang, M., ""Behavior prediction and core keywords suggestion of 2006 portal visitors"" (2006) 2006 Web Biz Conference: Working Out the Successful Strategy of Web Business Through the Analysis of Customer Behaviors, , paper presented at the Seoul, Korea, 6 March 2006, Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry",Review,Scopus

The scope of the repository, which started with newspaper clippings, has been enhanced to accommodate research papers, speeches/lectures, office orders/memorandums, videos, annual reports and the in-house publications. Design/methodology/approach - A comparative study of the available open source digital library software is made taking into consideration the availability of technical support, possibility of hands on training and the resources available for implementing the IR. Logical approach is made in building different communities, collections and decisions are taken in sharing the responsibility of maintaining different collections. Findings - The paper provides evidence on how the ISRO HQ IR was built from scratch and how different collections with numerous forms and formats can be accommodated using DSpace software. Many problems were faced during customisation of metadata forms for different collections apart from Dublin Core metadata fields. DSpace allows workflow and customisation as per institutional requirements. It supports community/collection based content and submission by different user communities. Research limitations/implications - This paper is a case study and limited only to ISRO HQ and describes the steps taken in implementing the IR considering the availability of technological infrastructure, manpower and possible collaboration of library with different sections/divisions at ISRO HQ.

Therefore, it is important to design searching and browsing tools that support them. However, many interfaces for children do not consider their skills and preferences. Children are capable of creating Boolean queries using category browsers, but have difficulty with the hierarchies used in many category-browsing interfaces because different branches of the hierarchy must be navigated sequentially and top-level categories are often too abstract for them to understand. Based on previous research, the authors believe using a flat category structure, where only leaf-level categories are available and can be viewed simultaneously, might better support children. However, this design introduces many more items on the screen and the need for paging or scrolling, all potential usability problems. To evaluate these tradeoffs, the authors conducted two studies with children searching and browsing using two types of category browsers in the International Children's Digital Library. Their results suggest that a flat, simultaneous interface provides advantages over a hierarchical, sequential interface for children in both Boolean searching and casual browsing. These results add to our understanding of children's searching and browsing skills and preferences, and possibly serve as guidelines for other children's interface designers.",,"Boolean algebra; Computer aided design; Digital libraries; Query languages; Usability engineering; User interfaces; Web browsers; Boolean queries; Casual browsing; Sequential navigation; Usability problems; Search engines","Ahlberg, C., Shneiderman, B., Visual information seeking: Tight coupling of dynamic query filters with starfield displays (1994) Proceedings of Human Factors in Computing, pp. 313-317; Borgman, C., Hirsh, S., Walter, A., Gallagher, A., Children's searching behavior on browsing and keyword online catalogs: The Science Library Catalog project (1995) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 46 (9), pp. 663-684; Busey, P., Doerr, T., Kid's catalog: An information retrieval system for children (1993) Youth Services in Libraries, 7 (1), pp. 77-84; (2002) Connected to the future: A report on children's, , http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/connected, Corporation for Public Broadcasting CPB, internet use.

The MF graphic library (MFGL) is the core of MF system, which is generally connected with a certain special CAD system, so data exchange with other CAD systems is relatively difficult. How to increase the using efficiency of MFGL by CAD data exchange technique and decrease repeating work are this paper concerns. Six parts are organized as follows: Firstly, data exchange status and problems in CAD domain were introduced. Tben, literatures in CAD field on data exchange and fixture element library systems as well as XML technology were deeply reviewed. XML provides a means for information transfer between different CAD manufacturing systems. So, in the third section, data mapping based on CSG method between MF graphics library (MFGL) and XML hierarchy was built. XML-based MF graphic system was addressed at the fourth part, which included several modules to realize the application of MF graphics library system trans-platforms. At last, conclusions and acknowledgements are in the fifth and sixth section separately.

Design/methodology/approach - A descriptive method has been used and users of the medical libraries and information centers affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences have been surveyed in the research. A total of 250 students were selected randomly as a sample. A structured questionnaire was designed for collecting data. Findings - The results were that 70 percent of students were aware of digital resources, but only 69 percent of them have used them; 62 percent were aware of offline databases, whereas only about 19 percent used them through the Central Library LAN network. About 70 percent were aware of online databases, accessible via the Central Library web site, and about 53 percent of respondents have used them. A total of 64 percent were aware of the ""CLBJ Database"", while over half of them made use of it. In total 87 percent of students felt that the available data resources met their information needs. Students had less use of offline databases, attributed to factors such as infrequent periodic orientation and lack of education on use of offline databases and fewer terminals connected to the server in the Central Library. Users are faced with problems like low speed connectivity and shortage of hardware facilities. Originality/value - When the user is aware of one resource, it will lead to more use of that resource. Isfahan University of Medical Sciences is aiming to develop new information centers and it needs to increase the extent of discovery of knowledge. On this base the paper has examined awareness, use and information retrieval of available digital resources and thus will be of benefit to others in a similar position.","Communication technologies; Digital libraries; Information retrieval; Iran; Medical libraries","Database systems; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Information science; Information technology; Medicine; Digital resources; Information communication technologies; Medical libraries; Medical science; Digital libraries","Asemi, A., ""Information searching habits of Internet users: A case study on the Medical Sciences University of Isfahan, Iran"" (2005) Webology, 2 (1). , www.webology.ir/2005/v2n1/a10.html, available at; Budd, J.M., Karen, A.W., ""CD-ROMs in academic libraries: A survey"" (1993) College & Research Librarians, 54 (6), pp. 529-535. , http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?&lowbar;nfpb= true&&lowbar;pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch& lowbar;SearchValue&lowbar;0=EJ473075&ERICExtSearch& lowbar;SearchType&lowbar;0=eric&lowbar;accno&objectId= 0900000b800.38316, available at; Curtis, K.L., Weller, A.C., Hurd, J.M., ""Information-seeking behavior of health sciences faculty: The impact of new information technologies"" (1997) Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 85 (4), pp. 402-410. , www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=226298, available at; Dee, C., Stanley, E.E., ""Information-seeking behavior of nursing students and clinical nurses: Implications for health sciences librarians"" (2005) Journal of the Medical Library Association, 93 (2), pp. 213-222; Dong, X., ""Searching information and evaluation of internet: A Chinese academic user survey"" (2003) International Information & Library Review, 35 (2-4), pp. 163-187; Dorsch, J.L., ""Information needs of rural health professionals: A review of the literature"" (2000) Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 88 (4), pp. 346-354. , http://dspace.lib.uic.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/123456789/60/1/ jo.pdf&num;search=%22 Information%20needs%20of%20rural%20health%20professionals%3A%20a%20 review%20of%20the%20literature%22, available at; Groote, S.L.D., Dorsch, J.L., ""Measuring use patterns of online journals and databases"" (2003) Journal of the Medical Library Association, 91 (2), pp. 231-241. , www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=153164, available at; Hewitson, A., ""Use and awareness of electronic information services by academic staff at Leeds Metropolitan University - A qualitative study"" (2002) Journal of Librarianship and Information Science., 34 (1), pp. 43-52. , available at: lis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/34/1/43; Kaewpadee, K., ""Problems of using the relation on web OPAC, information retrieval of students in the Academic Resources Center, Mahasarakham University"" (1999), MA(LISc.) dissertation, Mahasarakham University, MahasarakhamLiu, M., Redfern, B., ""Information seeking behavior of multicultural students: A case study at San Jose State University"" (1997) College & Research Libraries, 58 (4), pp. 348-354. , www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlpubs/crljournal/backissues1997b/july97/ liu.pdf&num;search=%22Information%20seeking%20behavior% 20of%20Multicultural%20Students%3A%20%20Case%20Study%20at%20San% 20Jose%20State20University%22, available at; Mutula, S.M., ""IT development in Eastern and Southern Africa: Implications for university libraries"" (2000) Library Hi-tech, 18 (4), pp. 320-334; Namarsa, P., ""Problems on CD-ROM searching services of graduate students"" (1999), MA(LISc.) dissertation, Mahasarakham University, MahasarakhamOlsen, K.R., ""Information needs of personnel implementing diagnostic prescriptive procedures with handicap students"" (1996) International Abstract, 37, pp. 919-920. , August; Pelzer, N.L., Wiese, W.H., Leysen, J.M., ""Library use and information-seeking behavior of veterinary medical students revisited in the electronic environment"" (1998) Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 86 (3), pp. 346-355. , www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=226381, available at; Pungbangpo, L., ""Information needs and information uses of faculty members and students of business administration faculties in private universities"" (1994), MA(LISc.) dissertation, Chulalongkorn University, BangkokSridhar, C.B., ""Internet: A powerful tool disseminating medical knowledge in urban and rural India"" (2001) SSGRR, , paper presented at L'Aquila, Italy; Tao, D., Demiris, G., Graves, R.S., Sievert, M., ""Transition from in library use of resources to outside library use: The impact of the internet on information seeking behavior of medical students and faculty"" (2003) AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings, (1027). , www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db= PubMed&list&lowbar;uids=14728530&dopt=Abstract, available at",Article,Scopus

For example, are we willing to give up our luxurious cars for more fuel-efficient models even though we know that the earth is warming? In an era where web-based student-centred inquiry is gaining popularity as a mode of teaching and learning about environmental issues and potentially developing students' environmental identities, the role of digital libraries needs to be better understood. An obvious affordance of such a digital library is that it organises information around themes for problems to be solved. A developmental project to build a first digital library for Geographical assets (G-Portal) was undertaken to allow students to conduct a field study of an environmental problem, within a geospatial context - in this case, beach erosion and sea level rise. G-Portal not only functions as a digital library of information resources, it also provides manipulation and analytical tools that can be used with the information. This allows students to explore the information, process the information, solve the problem posed and form new understandings and reflections of their role in the natural environment. © 2007 C-H.

There is great diversity in document image classifiers: they differ in the problems they solve, in the use of training data to construct class models, and in the choice of document features and classification algorithms. We survey this diverse literature using three components: the problem statement, the classifier architecture, and performance evaluation. This brings to light important issues in designing a document classifier, including the definition of document classes, the choice of document features and feature representation, and the choice of classification algorithm and learning mechanism. We emphasize techniques that classify single-page typeset document images without using OCR results. Developing a general, adaptable, high-performance classifier is challenging due to the great variety of documents, the diverse criteria used to define document classes, and the ambiguity that arises due to ill-defined or fuzzy document classes. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Class models; Classification algorithms; Document categorization; Document classification; Document classifiers; Document features; Document image classification; Feature representations; Learning mechanisms; Performance evaluation","Digital libraries; Fuzzy sets; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Classification algorithms; Document classifiers; Document image classification; Feature representations; Information retrieval systems","Appiani, E., Cesarini, F., Colla, A.M., Diligenti, M., Gori, M., Marinai, S., Soda, G., Automatic document classification and indexing in high-volume applications (2001) Int.

How to retrieve interesting information from the promising XML data is an active research area. Among techniques in this area, the description of query patterns is a crucial section. This paper reviews the actualities of recent researches on this topic. It classifies the query descriptors into two categories, XML Query type and XML IR type (with three subcategories: XML IR/keyword, XML IR/fragment and XML IR/query), and concludes three popular problems: Twig pattern processing, SLCA (smallest lowest common ancestor) problem, and similarity measuring techniques for retrieved XML fragments. It analyzes the virtue and deficiency of related techniques based on their convenience for common users. And hereby it proposes four issues for further XML querying researches: structural keywords and corresponding structural similarity measuring, wiping off the redundancy in XML data processing between XML Query (including XML IR/query) and XML IR/keyword, theoretical discussion of XML Query and its realization, and the management of peculiar XML data.","Dewey encoding; Similarity measuring; SLCA (smallest lowest common ancestor); Structural join; TF*IDF; Tree edit distance; Twig; VSM; XML IR; XML keyword search; XML query; XPath; XQuery; XQuery FT","Data representation; Dewey encoding; Electronic business; Query descriptor; Query pattern; Similarity measuring; Smallest lowest common ancestor (SLCA); Structural join; Tree edit distance; Twig; Twig pattern processing; Vector space model (VSM); XML fragment; XML IR; XML keyword search; XML query; XPath; XQuery; XQuery FT; Data processing; Database systems; Digital libraries; Electronic commerce; Information retrieval; Query processing; Web services; XML","Meng, X.F., Zhou, L.X., Wang, S., State of the art and trends in database research (2004) Journal of Software, 15 (12), pp. 1822-1836. , http://www.jos.org.cn/1000-9825/15/1822.htm, Chinese source; Kong, L.B., Tang, S.W., Yang, D.Q., Wang, T.J., Gao, J., XML indices (2005) Journal of Software, 16 (12), pp. 2063-2079. , http://www.jos.org.cn/1000-9825/16/2063.htm, Chinese source; Abiteboul, S., Quass, D., McHugh, J., Widom, J., Wiener, J., The Lorel query language for semistructured data (1997) Int'l Journal on Digital Libraries, 1 (1), pp. 68-88; Deutsch, A., Fernandez, M., Florescu, D., Levy, A., Suciu, D., A query language for XML (1999) Computer Networks, 31 (11-16), pp. 1155-1169; Ceri, S., Comai, S., Damiani, E., Fraternali, P., Paraboschi, S., Tanca, L., XML-GL: A graphical language for querying and restructuring XML documents (1999) Computer Networks, 31 (11-16), pp. 1171-1187; Chamberlin, D., Robie, J., Florescu, D., Quilt: An XML query language for heterogeneous data sources (2000) Proc. of the Int'l Workshop on the Web and Databases (WebDB 2000), pp. 1-25. , Suciu D. and Vossen G.

A Web/URL citation of an online journal article is a Web mention of its title, URL, or both. For each discipline, except psychology, we found significant correlations between Thomson Scientific (formerly Thomson ISI, here: ISI) citations and both Google Scholar and Google Web/URL citations. Google Scholar citations correlated more highly with ISI citations than did Google Web/URL citations, indicating that the Web/URL method measures a broader type of citation phenomenon. Google Scholar citations were more numerous than ISI citations in computer science and the four social science disciplines, suggesting that Google Scholar is more comprehensive for social sciences and perhaps also when conference articles are valued and published online.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis focuses on the 27 libraries with journals that answered a survey, and impact is evaluated by means of the survey's closed and open questions. This research covers the following aspects: selection and acquisition, human resources, technical processes, informatics, marketing, users services, library cooperation, and publishing. Findings - The research outlines the extent to which electronic reference services are being used in Argentina, and the analysis reveals reasons why leading private academic libraries have included electronic journals in their collections. The number of universities granting access to electronic journals has increased slowly over the last five years, though libraries count on a rich variety of electronic journals subscriptions - particularly databases. There is a lack of uniformity with regard to the adoption of standard criteria for cataloguing electronic journals - though over 50 percent said they did catalogue them. Originality/value - Although the study is limited to the Argentine private academic library system, it provides further insight into the realities of private academic libraries in Argentina regarding access, use, and publishing of electronic journals - which, because of the inherent problems of duplication and cost, pose a great challenge to information professionals today.","Academic libraries; Argentina; Electronic journals; Library management","Database systems; Information management; Information services; Electronic journals; Electronic reference services; Library management; Digital libraries","(1998) Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, , American Library Association American Library Association, Chicago, IL; (2002) Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, , American Library Association 2nd ed., American Library Association, Chicago, IL; (2003) ""El Portal Argentino Del Conocimiento Científico"", , www.biblioteca.secyt.gov.ar, Biblioteca Electrónica de Ciencia y Tecnología available at: (accessed 27 May 2005); Bustos González, A., ""Metodología para la evaluación de revistas científicas electrónicas"" (2000) Simposio Electrónico De Revistas Electrónicas, 1o, p. 5. , Buenos Aires, September 11-October 6; ""Consejo de Rectores de Universidades Privadas"" (2003) Biblioteca Virtual, , www.crup.org.ar/, Consejo de Rectores de Universidades Privadas available at:; Deveze, G., ""Uso de la biblioteca digital: El caso de la Universidad de Palermo"" (2003) Jornada Sobre La Biblioteca Digital Universitaria, , www.amicus.udesa.edu.ar/1bibliotecadigital/JBD_DEVEZE%20PALERMO.htm, 1o, Buenos Aires, June available at: (accessed 27 May 2005); Giordanino, E.P., ""Revistas electrónicas: Vino nuevo en odres nuevos"" (2001) Simposio Electrónico De Revistas Electrónicas, , 2o Buenos Aires, June; Gómez, N., ""Comentarios durante el Simposio Electrónico las revistas electrónicas"" (2000) Simposio Electrónico Las Revistas Electrónicas, , 1o, Buenos Aires, September 11-October 6; Guillén, K., Alonso Reyes, R., ""Las revistas electrónicas: Impacto en los usuarios de la información en Camaguey (Cuba)"" (2000) Información, Cultura Y Sociedad, (2), pp. 71-83; ""International standard bibliographic description for serials"" (1999), www.ifla.org/VII/s13/pubs/isbd.htm, International Federation of Library Associations International Federation of Library Associations, London, available at(2006) ""The Scholarly Journal Archive"", , www.jstor.org, JSTOR available at; Luther, J., ""Full text journal subscriptions: An evolutionary process"" (1997) ARL Directory of Electronic Newsletters and Academic Discussion List, , http://db.arl.org/luther.html, available at; Martino, L., Pandiello Pascua, A.M., ""La capacitación de usuarios de la biblioteca digital: El caso de la Universidad del Salvador"" (2003) Jornada Sobre La Biblioteca Digital Universitaria, , www.amicus.udesa.edu.ar/1bibliotecadigital/JBD_USAL.htm, 1o, Buenos Aires, June available at; Munster, I., ""La crisis de las bibliotecas universitarias argentinas"" (2003) SALALM, , 1o, Cartagena Colombia; (2000) ""Electronic Journals & Newsletters"", , http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/NewJourWel.html, available at; Patalano, M., ""Análisis de los sitios web de las bibliotecas universitarias argentinas"" (2002) El Profesional De La Información, 11 (2), pp. 102-110; Ramos Simón, L.F., (2003) El Impacto De Las Publicaciones Electrónicas En Las Bibliotecas Universitarias, , Universidad Complutense de Madrid Madrid; Rodríguez, A., ""La experiencia de la UNAM en la selección, adquisición y administración de revistas electrónicas de texto completo, Infodiversidad"" (2001) Sociedad De Investigaciones Bibliotecológicas, 3, pp. 21-35; Rogers, S.A., ""Electronic journal usage at Ohio State University"" (2001) College & Research Libraries, p. 25. , January; (2006) ""Scientific Electronic Library Online"", , www.scielo.br, SCIELO available at",Article,Scopus

Although assigning tight tolerances to all parts would solve the problem, an economical solution is taking advantage of small motions that joints allow, such that critical dimensions are adjusted during assembly processes. This paper presents a systematic method that decomposes product geometry at an early stage of design, selects joint types, and generates subassembly partitioning to achieve the adjustment of the critical dimensions during assembly processes. A genetic algorithm generates candidate assemblies based on a joint library specific for an application domain. Each candidate assembly is evaluated by an internal optimization routine that computes the subassembly partitioning for optimal in-process adjustability, by finding a series of minimum cuts on weighted graphs. A case study on a three-dimensional automotive space frame with the accompanying joint library is presented.

The EU IST ELENA project addressed this problem by developing an SQI standard for querying learning repositories, creating a system for goal-driven human capital development, and implementing a personalized search engine for learning resources. With this engine a learner can query a network of educational nodes and rank the results according to the personal information from his learner profile. In this paper we describe the results of our study that assessed effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction of personalized search for learning resources in educational networks. The testing methodology is also presented, as well as future work.","Evaluation; Learning repositories; Learning resources; Personalization; Ranking; Search","Digital libraries; Education; Internet; Online searching; Search engines; Learning repositories; Learning resources; Personalization; Learning systems","Blomgren, L., Vallo, H., Bystrm, K., Evaluation of an information system in an information seeking process (2004) Proceedings of ECDL 2004, pp. 57-68; Borlund, P., Ingwersen, P., Measures of relative relevance and ranked half-life: Performance indicators for interactive IR (1998) Proceedings of the 21st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 324-331; Smart learning space description (2005) Deliverable D4.4 of the ELENA Project, , http://www.elena-project.org, Brantner, S.

The project kopal tackles this problem head-on: in a three-year project kopal's objective is the practical testing and implementation of a cooperatively created and operated long-term archival system for digital resources. Design/methodology/approach - The system will be implementedin accordance with international standards for long-term archiving and metadata within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) framework. The project partners, Die Deutsche Bibliothek (DDB), Göttingen State and University Library (SUB Göttingen), IBM Deutschland GmbH and the Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG), will establish a cooperatively transferable solution for cultural heritage institutions, as well as for business and industry. Findings - Within the project, the project partners DDB and SUB Göttingen are developing software for the input and access of data, which will be released under an open-source license. Research limitations/implications - Long-term preservation methods and strategies will be discussed in general in the paper. Practical implications - The project will present a stable and reusable platform for additional partners and users, especially for cultural heritage organisations. Originality/value - The solution is based on Digital Information and Archiving System (DIAS), jointly devised by IBM and the National Library of The Netherlands in The Hague, and it will be adapted to the needs of the project with several extensions. Establishing a collaborative solution for long-term preservation is a milestone in the development of systems for the long-term availability of digital objects.","Archives management; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Germany",,"Neubauer, M., Wollschläger, T., ""Maschinelle Gewinnung technischer Metadaten für die Langzeitarchivierung elektronischer Publikationen"" (2006) B.I.T.

In addition, libraries have dramatically expanded their e-journal holdings through consortial agreements, publisher licenses, and aggregator subscriptions. User studies show a marked increase in the use of e-journals and a growing reliance on online journals for scholarship and instruction. The increased availability and usage of electronic journals has presented libraries with critical management, bibliographic control, and access problems. This paper explores e-resource management and bibliographic control mechanisms and access solutions, and examines the evolving relationship between e-resource management systems, the online catalog, local link resolvers, and full-text e-journal repositories. To address these interoperability issues, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Library has developed several management and access tools. The Online Research Resources (ORR) combines a relational database, a searchable A-to-Z list, and elements of an electronic resources management system. The Journal and Article Locator (JAL) utilizes metasearch technologies over the ORR, the local OPAC, the local link resolver server, and the CrossRef metadata database to provide unified access to both electronic and print journal holdings and full-text articles. © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - Different categories of digital collections based on guidelines defined by the authors are presented. Issues related to public access are illustrated. A model using the FRBR entities relationships is proposed to improve the accessibility of digital cultural materials so that scholarly research can be enhanced. The number of digital collections has been increased significantly since the late 1990s, but few studies investigated how these collections were organized and managed. To attain an understanding of the current status of institutional digital collections, various collection sites were examined and analyzed. The study focused on the existence and level of richness of bibliographic descriptions provided for each image; whether a search engine was available or not; how easily the search could be performed; and how search results were organized. The presentation of search results is problematic. Applying the IFLA FRBR model to digital materials can bring a solution. Findings - The IFLA FRBR model presents the search results hierarchically so that related materials can be easily collocated. This feature meets the end-users needs. The attributes of work and expression entities presented in the IFLA FRBR model should be applied differently for event-based digital cultural materials. Defining work- or expression-level entities under the event or theme will be more logical than under author and/or title for cultural materials. Doing expression-level cataloging might also work for this type of materials. Originality/value - Before building a digital collection, institutions should have a well-thought-out and well-planned collection management mechanism. Metadata scheme, content standards and content management system are important fundamentals. Much can be done to improve the accessibility of digital collections. The proposed FRBRized approach will make the retrieval of digital cultural objects easier.","Cataloguing; Content management; Digital libraries; Search engines",,"Besser, H., ""Image databases: The first decade, the present, and the future"" (1997) Digital Image Access and Retrieval, pp. 11-28. , Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Heidorn, P.B.

Design/methodology/approach - The package was developed using the distance education approach with STOU Plan, STOU Plan 2000 and GMS-VU applied. The distance education model for the web-based self-training package was composed of five stages: identifying the learners, design of the package, production of the package, establishing the delivery system, and evaluation. The system development methodology was based on the system development lifecycle (SDLC) with a combination of waterfall, phased and prototyping approaches. There are several phase in SDLC to carry out: problem and objective identification, requirement determination, requirement analysis, package design, package implementation, delivery system and evaluation. Evaluation of the package was conducted in two phases: formative evaluation and summative evaluation using the focus group discussion method. Formative evaluation was conducted during the package development by experts in the field prior to the summative evaluation. The summative evaluation was conducted after the package development had been completed as a pilot study for field trial by target users, consisting of junior library staff and library users. All comments were reviewed and refined in terms of instructional content, design, overall opinion and learning progress before put on production. Findings - The package consists of three main components: About the project, Study modules, References and further readings. Study modules, which is the most important component, consists of ten instructional modules focusing on information retrieval, and self-assessment through pre-test and post-test. The package includes multimedia such as images and sound to attract learners during their learning session. The delivery mode for the self-training package offers both online and off-line modes. Online mode is offered when there is network facility and internet connection available, while offline mode is offered through CD-ROM without requiring network and internet connection. The features and functions of both modes are identical. Moreover, print materials are also included as supplementary media. Originality/value - Since the module is a self-directed learning or self-training tool in information retrieval it can be employed for junior library staff and library users; it provides a training tool for librarians to train library users and supports human resource and development to narrow digital divides and support the right to access information. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer based learning; Distance learning; E-learning; Information retrieval","CD-ROM; Digital libraries; Distance education; Internet; Learning systems; Multimedia systems; Online searching; Electronic learning; System development life cycle; Web-based self training package; Information retrieval systems","Adams, K., Bicknell-Holmes, T., Latta, G.F., ""Supporting distance learners and academic faculty teaching at a distance"" (1998) 14th Annual Conference on Distance Teaching and Learning, , paper presented at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI; Behrens, S.J., ""Obstacles to user education for off campus students: Lecturers' attitudes to library skills"" (1993) Proceedings of the Sixth Off-campus Library Services Conferences, Central Michigan University, Mt.

The information gathered was supplemented by data obtained from the transaction logs. Findings - The results have revealed the use made of the OPAC and the characteristics of the searches performed. Users are still confronted by classic problems of information seeking: information overload, errors in subject searching, and the predominant use of the system's simpler options. The results show that the OPAC is broadly used by end-users not only for obtaining printed material, but also for connecting to the electronic resources subscribed to by the library.

The aim of this paper is to share the experience gained and invite comments and suggestions for further improvement. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes a case study of TERI's Integrated Digital Library resources and digitization in detail and how the digital resources can be accessed through a single window. It also deals with basic problems and suggests practical solutions. Findings - The paper finds that TERI Integrated Digital Library has been created to provide access to all digital and digitized offline and online resources, online e-journals, electronic documents and virtual resources, and virtual libraries. The purpose of the integrated library is to provide a single window to researchers, through which they can access all the resources (both digitally born resources and digitized documents). Once users are able to access the Digital Library homepage, all the electronic resources are accessible using linkages with a single click, no matter whether they are available in a database or as a simple file in a virtual collection. A physical digital library has been created to address access to all the LAN connected systems that provide CD-ROM access and journals and books downloaded or purchased for all time free access to in-house users. Research limitations/implications - Integration has helped in saving researchers' valuable time. Library management has become easier and much more effective than was previously the case. Any additions to existing resources are announced by e-mail for user access. Future plans are to make the resources highly interoperable across platforms or applications, so that platforms should not be a problem. Once a search is initiated, the search engine from the main search window should be able to hand over the search to subsequent search windows for any given database (bibliographic and full text). Once a search is handed over to the subordinate search engines, it should be able to retrieve the items and display the retrieved items in the main window. Future libraries seem to have no escape from the integrated digital library approach other than to an integrated digital collection that will make all available resources accessible from a single window. Originality/value - This paper could be useful for small and medium special and research libraries who do not have enough funds to start with commercially available digital library software. This paper shows the way to start using Open Source Software, which is easy to use and has been used by the libraries with little effort. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Electronic books; Electronic journals; Integration; Search engines","Information services; Libraries; Local area networks; Online searching; Search engines; Digital library software; Electronic books; Electronic journals; Integrated Digital Library initiative; Digital libraries",,Article,Scopus

They are the basis of programming techniques in diverse areas ranging from conventional general-purpose programming to software for safety-critical embedded systems. Current work on improving templates focuses on the notion of concepts (a type system for templates), which promises significantly improved error diagnostics and increased expressive power such as concept-based overloading and function template partial specialization. This paper presents C++ templates with an emphasis on problems related to separate compilation. We consider the problem of how to express concepts in a precise way that is simple enough to be usable by ordinary programmers. In doing so, we expose a few weakness of the current specification of the C++ standard library and suggest a far more precise and complete specification. We also present a systematic way of translating our proposed concept definitions, based on use-patterns rather than function signatures, into constraint sets that can serve as convenient basis for concept checking in a compiler.

The analysis of data collected covers awareness of EIS services, use of e-journals, advanced search facilities, acquaintance with electronic information sources, the purpose of using e-information, problems faced by the users while using EIS, infrastructure facility available and satisfaction level of users. Findings - The study found that Boolean logic and truncation are the most often used search facilities by IIT users. Lack of printing facilities, terminals and trained staff are the major reasons that would discourage users from accessing the EIS. The survey also reveals that some 60 per cent of users face difficulties while browsing e-information.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper addresses three common needs in academia with respect to image collections: preservation, access, and reuse. In the framework of the specific project experience, it discusses how usability issues have been tackled at design time, highlights the usability problems revealed by tests on the first implemented prototype, and advances proposals on how these problems may be addressed. Findings - Team formation and high turn-over impact usability design; collection management functionalities effect final product usability; usability and resource reuse levels are severely reduced if the services are limited to those of classic digital libraries. Research limitations/implications - All usability issues are discussed with respect to the specific project characterized by a small, in-house development team with high turn-over; a participatory design approach; a fairly small, accessible, and heterogeneous user (and stakeholder) population; very imited financial resources but also limited time constraints. Practical implications: A usability guide for future developers of digital image libraries in academia.

Design/methodology/approach - Using secondary literature, the author established a hypothesis about the way in which academic researchers engage with electronic texts. It is argued that academics are often distrustful of the authenticity of much that appears in digital form and doubtful as to its accuracy. The case studies are used as a means to demonstrate the measures that library and information professionals can take to assuage these concerns. Findings - Given reasonable financial resources and staff, it is relatively easy to adopt a transparently academic approach. Accuracy is much more problematic, and is often compromised by the unwieldy nature of these types of projects. Originality/value - Most evaluations of digitisation projects have not focused on the issues of academic authenticity and textual accuracy; indeed, the latter is difficult to gauge when the ASCII text is hidden and where there is little incentive for designers to be honest about the potential flaws in their search engines. Also, there has been little discussion in academic literature on the distribution of staff and financial resources within projects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accuracy; Digital libraries; History; Ireland; Quality assurance",,"Chapman, S., Working with printed text and manuscripts (2000) Handbook for Digital Projects: A Management Tool for Preservation and Access, pp. 113-20. , Sitts, M.K.

The Birmingham Institute of Art and Design (BIAD) Archives activity is evaluated to determine whether a project-based approach recognises and meets the needs of historians, or in manufacturing a digital semblance, does it in fact mislead historians. Design/methodology/approach - The context in UK higher education and the archives domain of an emphasis on the digitisation of resources evident in national policies is outlined. Recent studies into the requirements and expectations of academics and historians as users of archives and digital resources are considered. BIAD Archives' creation of a repository web site and participation in national collection level description schemes are examined. The experience of two collaborative digitisation projects, a national subject-based virtual collection and a regional collaborative information literacy initiative, are described and reflected upon. Findings - An opportunistic project-based approach does not easily accumulate as a cohesive strategy for increasing access. Collaboration is problematic. It is beneficial in raising profiles and can act as a legitimising agent. It entails compromise, applying an external filter to collections and potentially creating a digital semblance. The proliferation of projects raises concerns of sustainability, invisibility within the deep web and that merely signposting may not satisfy user needs. To address this problem archives as a domain require a more sophisticated understanding of all our different users. Originality/value - Critical reflections on collaborative practice beneficial to archivists and resource managers embarking on digitisation initiatives and to those developing collaborative projects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Archives management; Art; Design; Digital libraries; Higher education; History",,"(2003) Fineart.ac.uk: The National Fine Art Education Digital Collection, , available at: www.fineart.ac.uk (accessed 17 May 2005); (2003) The National Fine Art Education Digital Collection Feasibility Study, , available at: http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/fineart/feasibility.html (accessed 17 May 2005); (2004) Listening to the Past, Speaking to the Future - Report of the Archives Task Force, , Museums, Libraries and Archives Council London available at: www.mla.gov.uk/documents/atfreport.pdf (accessed 17 May 2005); Arnold-Foster, K., Weeks, J., (2000) Totems and Trifles: Museums and Collections of Higher Education Institutions in the Midlands, , West Midlands Regional Museums Council Bromsgrove; Cameron, F., World of museums, wired collections - The next generation (2001) Museum Management and Curatorship, 19 (3), pp. 309-15; Duff, W., Johnson, C., Accidentally found on purpose: Information-seeking behavior of historians in archives (2002) Library Quarterly, 72 (4), pp. 472-500; Gaskin, A.J., (1927) When a Poor Man Came in Sight, Gathering Winter Fuel, , illustration to Good King Wenceslas, woodcut on paper tissue, BIAD School of Art Archive; Geser, G., Resource discovery - Position paper: Putting the user first (2004) DigiCULT Thematic Issue 6 - Resource Discovery Technologies for the Heritage Sector, pp. 7-12. , Geser, G.

Design/methodology/approach - In conventional solutions, a mediator is adopted to create and maintain the matching between relevant terms such that distinct but relevant metadata schemas can be integrated according to the mapping relationships in the mediator. However, such solutions suffer some problems originated from the static matching in mediator. This paper proposes to use facts to express the relationships among heterogeneous schemas and conduct the reasoning dynamically by using inference engines. Findings - It is justified to use facts and inference engines to express and operate the semantics among heterogeneous but relevant information resources. The user can choose to convert only part of the XML document into facts if she can unpeel deeply nested XML tags. Additionally, it is possible for the user to manually edit (assert, update or retract) the facts as needed in the reasoning. Research limitations/implications - The study assumes that peers are clustered according to shared topics or interest. An exhaust evaluation has not been conducted. Practical implications - Each node can publish its schema to the involved peer community such that other peers can automatically discover the specific schema. A local matchmaking engine is adopted as well in order to automatically generate the relations between its own schema and the retrieved ones.

The library provides all necessary functions for the use of the PEM and its truncated version (TPEM) in a model independent way. The PEM/TPEM replaces the exact diagonalization of the one electron sector in models for fermions coupled to classical fields. The computational cost of the algorithm is O(N) - with N the number of lattice sites - for the TPEM [N. Furukawa, Y. Motome, J. Phys. Soc. Japan 73 (2004) 1482] which should be contrasted with the computational cost of the diagonalization technique that scales as O(N4). The method is applied for the first time to a double exchange model with finite Hund coupling and also to diluted spin-fermion models.

Method of solution: Typically an exact diagonalization of the electronic sector is performed in this type of models for each configuration of classical fields, which are integrated using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm. A polynomial expansion of the density of states is able to replace the exact diagonalization, decreasing the computational complexity of the problem from O(N4) to O(N) and allowing for the study of larger lattices and more complex and realistic systems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Many academic libraries are providing access to e-book resources that are free-of-charge, and those libraries offering e-book subscriptions are using the World Wide Web for their platform. There are similar issues in the take-up of e-books to those regarding the take-up of other electronic resources, such as e-ACjournals. These include changes in professional and management skills, such as collection development, marketing and evaluation, user education, technological skills and communication skills.","Academic libraries; Collections management; Electronic books; Librarians; Research; United Kingdom","Curricula; Digital libraries; Education; Electronic commerce; Information technology; Marketing; Research; Search engines; Students; Academic libraries; Collections management; Electronic books; Librarians; Internet","Armstrong, C., Edwards, L., Lonsdale, R., Virtually there?

Building a good digital collection has been a common task, pervasive in all types of libraries. Digitization becomes more and more crucial, affecting libraries while they work towards becoming digital. Researchers and practitioners would like to know what practices have been developed to deal with the challenges that pose the most significant problems or concerns for libraries in digitization. Through probing some widespread issues on what materials to digitize, and the associated standards and technologies in digitization in US libraries, this survey of current literature reveals a number of prominent library digitization practices, methods and challenges, and highlights the best practices, trends and interests in library digitization pertaining to both policy and technology marketplace issues.","Digital libraries; Document image processing; Electronic media; United States of America","Data processing; Digital libraries; Multimedia systems; Project management; Public policy; Societies and institutions; Standards; Electronic media; Information and Library Science; Technical problems; United States of America; Analog to digital conversion","(2003) About Alexa, , http://pages.alexa.com/company/history.html; (2001) Local History/special Collections, , www.alexandria.lib.va.us/lhsc_online_collection_guides/archive/archive. html; Arms, W.Y., (2003) Digital Libraries, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; (2003) Mellon Foundation Grant Helps Create Digital Video Archive of World Music, , www.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/spew4th.pl?ascribeid=20030505.113326&time= 12%2042%20PDT&year=2003&public=1; Atkins, A., Fox, E., France, R., Suleman, H., ETD-MS: An interoperability metadata standard for electronic theses and dissertations - Version 1.00, revision 2 (2003) Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, , www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/current.html; Bertocco, S., Torii, an open portal over open archives (2001) High Energy Physics Libraries Webzine, (4). , http://library.cern.ch/HEPLW/4/papers/4/; Bray, T., (2003) What Is RDF?

An analysis of research conducted within two contrasting domains (clinical and academic) is presented which highlights issues of user interactions, work practices and organisational social structures. The combined study comprises an analysis of 98 in-depth interviews and focus groups with lecturers, librarians and hospital clinicians. The importance of current and past roles of the library, and how users interacted with it, are revealed. Web-based DLs, while alleviating most library resource and interaction problems, require a change in librarians' and DL designers' roles and interaction patterns if they are to be implemented acceptably and effectively. Without this role change, users will at best be unaware of these digital resources and at worst feel threatened by them. The findings of this paper highlight the importance of DL design and implementation of the social context and supporting user communication (i.e., collaboration and consultation) in information searching and usage activities. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Digital libraries; Grounded theory; Social structures; Usability; User communities",,"Adams, A., Blandford, A., Digital libraries in a clinical setting: Friend or foe (2001) Proceedings of ECDL'01, pp. 224-231. , Damstadt, Germany, 4-9 September 2001.

These three methods were compared by means of an evaluation of an online library catalogue, which involved four points of comparison: number and type of usability problems detected; relevance of the problems detected; overall task performance; and participant experiences. The results of the study showed that there were only few significant differences between the usability test approaches, mainly with respect to manner of problem detecting, task performance and participant experience. For the most part, the usability methods proved very much comparable, revealing similar numbers and types of problems that were equally relevant. Taking some practical aspects into account, a case can be made for preferring the concurrent think-aloud protocols over the other two methods. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Using a co-discovery technique with a team of three expert usability inspectors (the authors), we performed a usability inspection driven by a broad set of anticipated user tasks. We found many good design features in NCSTRL, but the primary result of a usability inspection is a list of usability problems as candidates for fixing. The resulting problems are organized by usability problem type and by system functionality, with emphasis on the details of problems specific to digital library functions. The resulting usability problem list was used to illustrate a cost/importance analysis technique that trades off importance to fix against cost to fix. The problems are sorted by the ratio of importance to cost, producing a priority ranking for resolution. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Cost-importance analysis; Digital library; Inspection; Usability; Usability problems",,"Andre, T., Hartson, H.R., Belz, S., McCreary, F., The user action framework: A reliable foundation for usability engineering support tools (2001) Int J Hum-Comput Stud, 54 (1), pp. 107-136; Bergmark, D., Models and tools for generating digital libraries: Collection synthesis (2002) Proceedings of the Second ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference On Digital Libraries (JCDL'02), pp. 253-262. , ACM Press, New York; Chen, S.-S., Choo, C.-Y., A DL server with OAI capabilities: LOVE (2002) Proceedings of the Second ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference On Digital Libraries (JCDL'02), p. 388. , ACM Press, New York, (poster); Davis, J.R., Lagoze, C., NCSTRL: Design and deployment of a globally distributed digital library (2000) J Am Soc Inf Sci, 51 (3), pp. 273-280; Dillon, A., Technologies of information: HCI and the digital library (2002) Human-computer Interaction In the New Millennium, pp. 457-474. , In: Carroll J, ACM Press/Addison-Wesley, New York; Dorward, J., Reinke, D., Recker, M., Preserving, securing, and assessing digital libraries: An evaluation model for a digital library services tool (2002) Proceedings of the Second ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference On Digital Libraries (JCDL'02), pp. 322-323. , ACM Press, New York; France, R.A., (2001), Personal communicationFutrelle, J., Chen, S.-S., Chang, K.C., A CIS framework for NSDL (2001) Proceedings of the First ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference On Digital Libraries (JCDL'01), pp. 124-125. , ACM Press, New York; Geisler, G., Giersch, S., McArthur, D., McClelland, M., Creating virtual collections in digital libraries: Benefits and implementation issues (2002) Proceedings of the Second ACM/IEEECS Joint Conference On Digital Libraries (JCDL'02), pp. 210-218. , ACM Press, New York; Glover, E.J., Lawrence, S., Gordon, M.D., Birmingham, W.P., Giles, C.L., Web search - your way (2001) Commun ACM, 44 (12), pp. 97-102; Gupta, A., Ludsher, B., Moore, R.W., Ontology services for curriculum development in NSDL (2002) Proceedings of the Second ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference On Digital Libraries (JCDL'02), pp. 219-220. , ACM Press, New York; Hackman, G.S., Biers, D.W., Team usability testing: Are two heads better than one?

As a fresh, lively and dynamic area with a lot of enthusiasm and activity by researchers from different disciplines, institutions and countries, digital libraries are viewed in different perspectives and the single most development that has brought about sweeping changes in the library and information discipline currently in the developed world is that of digital libraries. Advancements in computer and information technology with breakthroughs in memory technology has not only reduced the cost of infrastructure required for hosting digital libraries, but the demonstrated success of a wide variety of projects in USA and Europe also endorsed the chances of their survival even in a developing country. Though the professionals and libraries in developing countries are also experiencing the virtues of Internet, and electronic information highways, many of these libraries have not gone much farther than the computerization of in-house operations, availing databases in electronic media such as CD-ROMs, and web access of subscribed journals and various free resources. Digital library development should be taken up as an additional task to populate the web sites with valuable in-house content like the research reports, publications of in-house researchers, and so on. Digital library projects and developments in the country are so many, though a large number of them are only at an aggressively enthusiastic preliminary stage. In a country such as India so rich in content of indigenous research and development in disciplines varied from science and technology to social science, humanities and spirituality, there is tremendous need for hosting full fledged digital libraries by appropriately tagging the content with affordable information technology. However, what is lacking, especially in developing countries, is a coordinated collaborative approach to bring in institutions and identifying content valuable for digitization with sufficient monetary and infrastructure support. The digital library development in the country needs a two-pronged strategy (i) to digitize local content, and (ii) to devise options for accessing external resources. Channels for internal content include journals and serials for research, conference proceedings, theses and dissertations and preprints, research and status reports, textbooks and learning materials, government publications, spiritual/heritage sources, tourism information, traditional knowledge, etc. As far as external resources are concerned, there are electronic options from publishers and information provides such as, online access through Web of subscribed journals, CDs and floppies containing supplementary material of printed books, bibliographic/full-text databases, which can be hosted on library servers or intranet along with local content. The problems for digital library development are manifold in India such as lack of interest, non-availability of computer and IT infrastructure for library activities, copyright problems, ensuring secure access, properly selecting content from the mass available, internet bandwidth, absence of sufficient financial support, over concentration of professional time on administrative routines, acute shortage over concentration of professional time on administrative routines, acute shortage of competent manpower, etc. The software boom engulfing the country, as a result of the big leap in computer penetration, sudden rise in proficient manpower, and sizable improvement in communication infrastructure should also be treated as an asset and taken advantage of by authorities and information professionals to create and maintain digital information facilities to usher in the new information age. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the problems to be addresses to achieve high software reuse is organizing databases of software experience, in which information on software products and processes is stored and organized to enhance reuse. Object-oriented software libraries expand in size more rapidly than other type of software library. This paper presents a simple approach for aiding reuse in software development using object-oriented library. Our approach improves the effectiveness of code searching by reorganizing the library with facet classification scheme and thesaurus. Information in specification models, such as Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), is extracted through object abstraction and then used as a query input. We are currently implementing a Computer-Aided Reuse Tool (CART) based on the approach.","CASE tools; Facet classification; Object-oriented library; Software reuse; Thesaurus","Computer aided software engineering; Data flow analysis; Digital libraries; Object oriented programming; Problem solving; Automatic code extractors; Computer-aided reuse tools (CART); Software asset libraries; Computer aided analysis","Aliabiso, B., Transformation of data flow analysis models to object-oriented design OOPSLA'99, pp. 335-353; Anderson, K.J., State-of-art in software reuse technologies COMPSAC'99 Panel on Software Reuses; Burton, B.A., Aragon, R.W., Bailey, S.A., Mayes, L.A., (1998) The Reusable Software Library, pp. 25-33. , IEEE Software Engineering, July; Caldiera, G., Basili, V.R., (1997) Identifying and Qualifying Reusable Software Components, pp. 61-70. , IEEE Computer, Feb; Helm, R., Maarek, Y.S., Integrating information retrieval and domain specific approaches for browing and retrieval in object-oriented class libraries OOPSLA'99, pp. 47-91; Houhamdi, Z., Ghoul, S., A reuse description formalism (2001) ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications AICCSA'2001, , Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon; Houhamdi, Z., Ghoul, S., A classification system for software reuse (2001) Fifth International Symposium on Programming System, ISPS2001, , USTHB Computer science Institute, Algiers, Algeria; Houhamdi, Z., A Specification language for software reuse (2001) 11th International Conference on Computers: Theory and Application, ICCTA2001, , CSS/IEEE Alexandria Chapter.

Prior approaches to encoding higher order functions in C++ have suffered with respect to polymorphic functions from either lack of expressiveness or high complexity. In contrast, FC++ offers full and concise support for higher-order polymorphic functions through a novel use of C++ type inference. The FC++ library has a number of useful features, including a generalized mechanism to implement currying in C++, a ""lazy list"" class which enables the creation of ""infinite data structures"", a subtype polymorphism facility, and an extensive library of useful functions, including a large part of the Haskell Standard Prelude. The FC++ library has an efficient implementation. We show the results of a number of experiments which demonstrate the value of optimizations we have implemented. These optimizations have improved the run-time performance by about an order of magnitude for some benchmark programs that make heavy use of FC++ lazy lists. We also make an informal performance comparison with similar programs written in Haskell.",,"C++; Functional programming; Polymorphic functions; Polymorphic operators; Computer programming languages; Data structures; Digital libraries; Embedded systems; Functions; Information analysis; Mathematical operators; Problem solving; Program compilers; Computer programming","Alexandrescu, A., (2001) Modern C++ Design, , Addison-Wesley; Boehm, H., Demers, A., (2002) The Boehm-Demers-Weiser Conservative Garbage Collector, , http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/; Briggs, K., (2002) The XR Exact Real Home Page, , http://www.btexact.com/people/briggsk2/XR.html; Dami, L., (1991) More Functional Reusability in C/C++/ Objective-C with Curried Functions, pp. 85-98. , Object Composition, Centre Universitaire d'Informatique, University of Geneva; Fokker, J., (1995) Functional Programming, , http://www.haskell.org/booksheli/functional-programming.dvi; Hamilton, J., Montana smart pointers: They're smart, and they're pointers (1997) Proc.

Consequently, cheaper and denser tertiary storage systems are being integrated into the storage hierarchies of these applications. Although tertiary storage is cheaper, the access latency is very high due to the need to load and unload media on the drives. This high latency and the bursty nature of I/O traffic result in the accumulation of I/O requests for tertiary storage. We study the problem of scheduling these requests to improve performance. In particular we address the issues of scheduling across multiple tapes or disks as opposed to most other studies which consider only one or two media. We focus on algorithms that minimize the number of switches and show through simulation that these result in near-optimal schedules. For single drive libraries an efficient algorithm that produces optimal schedules is developed. For multiple drives the problem is shown to be NP-Complete. Efficient and effective heuristics are presented for both single and multiple drives. The scheduling policies developed achieve significant performance gains over naive policies. The algorithms are simple to implement and are not restrictive. The study encompasses all types of storage libraries handling removable media, such as tapes and optical disks.","I/O scheduling; Multiple drives; Optimal; Removable media; Single-drive; Tape libraries","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Heuristic methods; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic tape storage; Multimedia systems; Optical disk storage; Storage allocation (computer); Multiple drives; Removable media; Tape libraries; Tertiary storage; Digital libraries","Andrews, M., Bender, M.A., Zhang, L., New algorithms for the disk scheduling problem (1996) Foundations of Computer Science; Carey, M.J., Haas, L.M., Livny, M., Tapes hold data, too: Challenges of tuples on tertiary store Proc.

It uses a predictive model based on facets of each Web page to select scholarly works. The criteria came from the academic library selection literature, and a Delphi study was used to refine the list to 41 criteria. A Perl program was designed to analyze a Web page for each criterion and applied to a large collection of scholarly and nonscholarly Web pages. Bibliomining, or data mining for libraries, was then used to create different classification models. Four techniques were used: logistic regression, nonparametric discriminant analysis, classification trees, and neural networks. Accuracy and return were used to judge the effectiveness of each model on test datasets. In addition, a set of problematic pages that were difficult to classify because of their similarity to scholarly research was gathered and classified using the models. The resulting models could be used in the selection process to automatically create a digital library of Web-based scholarly research works. In addition, the technique can be extended to create a digital library of any type of structured electronic information.",,"Computer programming languages; Data structures; Decision theory; Digital libraries; Intelligent agents; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Websites; Bibliomining; Classification trees; Logistic regression; Nonparametric discriminant analysis; Pattern-matching computer language; Web-based scholarly research works; Data mining","Banerjee, K., Is data mining right for your library?

It sought to identify what works well and what is problematic with respect to the management of commercial products. Views were also sought on future development, and how procurement could best be managed. The main concerns identified were the lack of a national dimension and strategy, and of expertise in individual authorities and consortia, particularly with licences. Purchasers were felt to be reactive, not taking control of the procurement by specifying requirements. E-resources were felt to be very expensive; there was not necessarily any price advantage as a result of consortial negotiations. It was also felt that hard-copy and e-resource procurement and strategy should not be separated. Licence terms and pricing models were felt to be confusing, and the interfaces provided inappropriate.","Electronic books; Electronic journals; Procurement; Public libraries; Purchasing","Decision making; Information technology; Purchasing; User interfaces; Public libraries; Digital libraries",,Review,Scopus

Instead of talking about existing problems (faults), developers now discuss ""potential problems,"" that is, aspects of the program that do not affect the quality initially, but could have deleterious consequences when the software goes through some maintenance or reuse. One type of potential problem is that of common coupling, which unlike other types of coupling can be clandestine. That is, the number of instances of common coupling between a module M and the other modules can be changed without any explicit change to M. This paper presents results from a study of clandestine common coupling in 391 versions of Linux. Specifically, the common coupling between each of 5332 kernel modules and the rest of the product as a whole was measured. In more than half of the new versions, a change in common coupling was observed, even though none of the modules themselves was changed. In most cases where this clandestine common coupling was observed, the number of instances of common coupling increased. These results provide yet another reason for discouraging the use of common coupling in software products.","Clandestine coupling; Common coupling; Coupling; Dependencies; Linux; Open-source software","Clandestine coupling; Common coupling; Coupling; Dependencies; Linux; Open-source software; Computer software; Digital libraries; Java programming language; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Computer science","Binkley, A.B., Schach, S.R., Validation of the coupling dependency metric as a predictor of run-time failures and maintenance measures (1998) Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 452-455; Briand, L.C., Daly, J., Porter, V., Wüst, J., A comprehensive empirical validation of design measures for object-oriented systems (1998) Proceedings of the 5th International Software Metrics Symposium, pp. 246-257; Kafura, D., Henry, S., Software quality metrics based on interconnectivity (1981) Journal of Systems and Software, 2 (2), pp. 121-131; Offutt, J., Harrold, M.J., Kolte, P., A software metric system for module coupling (1993) Journal of Systems and Software, 20 (3), pp. 295-308; Page-Jones, M., (1980) The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design, , New York, Yourdon Press, 1980; Schach, S.R., (2002) Object-oriented and Classical and Software Engineering, 5th Ed., , Boston, WCB/McGraw-Hill; Selby, R.W., Basili, V.R., Analyzing error-prone system structure (1991) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 17 (2), pp. 141-152; Stevens, W.P., Myers, G.J., Constantine, L.L., Structured design (1974) IBM Systems Journal, 13 (2), pp. 115-139; Ttoy, D.A., Zweben, S.H., Measuring the quality of structured designs (1981) Journal of Systems and Software, 2, pp. 112-120; (2000) What Is Linux?, , http://www.linux.org/info/index.html, Linux online, 6 March; Wulf, W., Shaw, M., Global variables considered harmful (1973) SIGPLAN Notices, 8 (2), pp. 28-34",Article,Scopus

Numerous incidents of buffer overflow attacks have been reported and many solutions have been proposed, but a solution that is both complete and highly practical is yet to be found. Another kind of vulnerability called format string overflow has recently been found and although not as widespread as buffer overflow, format string overflow attacks are no less dangerous. This article surveys representative techniques of exploiting buffer overflow and format string overflow vulnerabilities and their currently available defensive measures. We also describe our buffer overflow detection technique that range checks the referenced buffers at run-time. We augment executable files with the type information of automatic buffers (local variables and parameters of functions) and static buffers (global variables in the data/bss section) and maintain the sizes of allocated heap buffers in order to detect an actual occurrence of buffer overflow. We describe a simple implementation with which we currently protect vulnerable copy functions in the C library.","Array and pointer range checking; Buffer overflow; ELF; Format string overflow; Linux","C (programming language); Digital libraries; Information technology; Security of data; Buffer overflow; Format string overflow; Pointer range checking; Buffer storage","http://www.cert.org, CERT Coordination Centerhttp://www.securityfocus.com/archive, Bugtraq Mailing ListWagner, D., Foster, J.S., Brewer, E.A., Aiken, A., A first step towards automated detection of buffer overrun vulnerabilities Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, San Diego, CA, February 2000, pp. 3-17; Cowan, C., Wagle, P., Pu, C., Beattie, S., Walpole, J., Buffer overflows: Attacks and defenses for the vulnerability of the decade Proceedings DARPA Information Survivability Conference and Exposition, Hilton Head, SC, January 2000, pp. 119-129; Smashing the stack for fun and profit (1996) Phrack, 7 (49). , Aleph One; How to write buffer overflows (1995), http://10pht.com/advisories/bufero.html, MudgeThe frame pointer overwrite (1999) Phrack, 9 (55). , Klog; Taking advantage of non-terminated adjacent memory spaces (2000) Phrack, 10 (56). , Twitch; Getting around non-executable stack (and fix) (1997) Bugtraq Mailing List, , http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/7480, Solar Designer; [August]; Wojtczuk, R., Defeating solar designer non-executable stack patch Bugtraq Mailing List, , http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/8470; The advanced return-into-lib(c) exploits: PaX case study (2001) Phrack, 10 (58). , Nergal; https://pageexec.virtualave.net, PaXNon-executable stack patch http://www.openwall.com/linux, Solar Designerhttp://cliph.linux.pl/kNoX, kNoXExecutable and Linkable Format Version 1.1, , ftp://download.intel.com/design/perftool/tis/elfllg.zip, TIS; Conover, M., (1999) W00w00 on Heap Overflows, , http://www.w00w00.org/files/articles/heaptut.txt, [January]; Rivas, J., Overwriting the .dtors section http://www.synnergy.net/downloads/papers/dtors.txtStallman, R.M., (1999) Using and Porting GNU CC (Version 2.95), , Free Software Foundation: Boston, MA; Bouchareine, P., Atexit in memory bugs-specific proof of concept with statically linked binaries and heap overflows http://community.corest.com/~juliano/heap_atexit.txtSmashing C++ VPTRs (2000) Phrack, 10 (56). , Rix; Kaempf, M., Vudo-an object superstitiously believed to embody magical powers (2001), http://www.synnergy.net/downloads/papers/vudo-howto.txtExploiting format string vulnerabilities (2001), http://www.team-teso.net/releases/formatstring-1.2.tar.gz, Scut, team teso; [September]Once upon a free() (2001) Phrack, 10 (57); Bypassing stackguard and stackshield (2000) Phrack, 10 (56). , Bulba, Kil3r; Cowan, C., Pu, C., Maier, D., Hinton, H., Walpole, J., Bakke, P., Beattie, S., Zhang, Q., StackGuard: Automatic adaptive detection and prevention of buffer-overflow attacks Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Security Symposium.

To reduce the demands on I/O and network resources, multi-resolution representations are being proposed for the storage organization of images. Image decomposition techniques such as wavelets can be used to provide these multi-resolution images. The original image is represented by several coefficients, one of them with visual similarity to the original image, but at a lower resolution. These visually similar coefficients can be thought of as thumbnails or icons of the original image. This paper addresses the problem of storing these multi-resolution coefficients on disks so that thumbnail browsing as well as image reconstruction can be performed efficiently. Several strategies are evaluated to store the image coefficients on parallel disks. These strategies can be classified into two broad classes, depending on whether the access pattern of the images is used in the placement. Disk simulation is used to evaluate the performance of these strategies. Simulation results are validated with results from experiments with real Disks, and are found to be in good qualitative agreement. The results indicate that significant performance improvements can be achieved with as few as four disks by placing image coefficients based upon browsing access patterns.","Browsing; Declustering; Multiresolution image storage; Parallel I/O; Wavelets","Computer simulation; Digital libraries; Image reconstruction; Image retrieval; Browsing; Multiresolution image storage; Digital image storage","Alexandrov, A.D., Ma, W.Y., El Abbadi, A., Manjunath, B.S., Adaptive filtering and indexing for image databases (1995) Proceedings SPIE Int.

One of the problems to be addresses to achieve high software reuse is organizing databases of software experience, in which information on software products and processes is stored and organized to enhance reuse. The Reuse Description Formalism (RDF) is a generalization of the faceted index approach to classification. It was initially designed as a tool to help increase reusability of software components at the code level (e.g. functions or subroutines). The goal of this study is to show that RDF can also be used effectively to represent and reuse other types of software knowledge. The emphasis here is on those proprieties of RDF that facilitates the representation of these objects. This paper demonstrates RDF's representation power by constructing sample classification taxonomy for software defects, and explains how this taxonomy can be used by the system tester to predict the types of defects associated with software components.","Classification; Reuse Description Formalism; Reuse library; Software defects; Taxonomy","Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Data structures; Digital libraries; Indexing (of information); Information management; Subroutines; Constructors; Software components; Computer software reusability","Basili, V., Rombach, Tailoring the software process to project goals and environments (1987) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 345-357. , IEEE Computer Society Press, California; Booch, G., (1987) Software Components with Ada, , Benjamin-Cumming Publishing Company, Menlo Park, California; Houhamdi, Z., Ghoul, S., A reuse description formalism ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA'2001, pp. 25-32. , 2201, Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon; Houhamdi, Z., Ghoul, S., A classification system for software reuse (2001) Fifth International Symposium on Programming System, ISPS2001, pp. 339-345. , USTHB Computer science Institute, Algiers, Algeria; Houhamdi, Z., A specification language for software reuse (2001) 11th International Conference On Computers: Theory and Application, ICCTA2001, pp. 125-133. , CSS/IEEE Alexandria Chapter, Head of Electrical Control, Alexandria, Egypt; Houhamdi, Z., Developing a reuse library (2001) 11th International Conference On Computers: Theory and Application, ICCTA2001, pp. 134-148. , CSS/IEEE Alexandria Chapter, Head of Electrical Control, Alexandria, Egypt; Houhamdi, Z., An adaptative approach to reuse software (2001) The Third Middle East Symposium on Simulation and Modeling, MESM'2001, pp. 108-113. , SCS/IEEE 2001, Amman University, Amman, Jordan; Houhamdi, Z., Software reuse: A new classification approach (2002) The International Symposium on Innovation in Information and Communication Technology, ISIICT'2001, pp. 247-258. , Philadelphia University, Amman, Jordan; Houhamdi, Z., Ghoul, S., Classifying software for reusability (2001) Mail of Technical and Scientific Knowledge, (1), pp. 41-47. , Periodic magazine of the university of Biskra, Algeria; Houhamdi, Z., Ghoul, S., RDF: A formalism for reusing software (2002) The South African Computer Journal, SART/SACJ, (29). , accepted; Rester, R., SEL ada reuse analysis and representation (1990) Technical Report, , NASA Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland; (1990) Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) Database Organization and User's Guide, , NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland., revision 1 edition; Prieto-Diaz, R., Domain analysis for software reusability (1987) Proceedings of the 11th International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSA '87), pp. 23-29. , IEEE Computer Society Press; Prieto-Diaz, R., Implementing faceted classification for software reuse (1991) Communication of the ACM, pp. 88-91; Straub, P.A., (1992) The Nature of Bias and Defects in the Software Specification Process, , Ph.D. thesis, computer Science Department, University of Maryland",Article,Scopus

These networks have been lauded for their potential to strengthen physical communities through increasing information flow about local services and events, and through facilitating civic interaction. However, little is known about how the public uses such digital services and what barriers they encounter. This article presents findings from a 2-year study that comprised a national survey with public library staff, followed by extensive case studies in three states. At each site, data were collected using on-line surveys, field observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups with Internet users, human service providers, and library staff. The on-line surveys and the follow-up interviews with respondents were based on sense-making theory. In our article we discuss: (1) how the public is using networked community information systems and the Internet for daily problem solving, (2) the types of barriers users encounter, and (3) the benefits for individuals and physical communities from public library-community networking initiatives and the emergence of ""information communities."".",,"Congestion control (communication); Human computer interaction; Internet; Online searching; Quality of service; User interfaces; Human service providers; Information community; Information seeking; Online community network; Online surveys; Public library; Digital libraries","Baker, L.M., Pettigrew, K.E., Theories for practitioners: Two frameworks for studying consumer health information-seeking behavior (1999) Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 87 (4), pp. 444-450; Baker, S.L., Ruey, E.D., Information and referral services - Attitudes and barriers: A survey of North Carolina public libraries (1988) Reference Quarterly, 28 (3), pp. 243-252; Bates, M., The design of browsing and berrypicking techniques for the online search interface (1989) Online Review, 13 (5), pp. 407-424; Bishop, A.P., Tidline, T., Shoemaker, S., Salela, P., Public libraries and networked information services in low-income communities (1999) Library & Information Science Research, 21 (3), pp. 361-390; Chatman, E.A., The impoverished life-world of outsiders (1996) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 47, pp. 193-206; Chatman, E.A., Framing social life in theory and research (2000) New Review of Information Behaviour Research: Studies of Information Seeking in Context, 1, pp. 3-17; Chen, C., Hernon, P., (1982) Information Seeking: Assessing and Anticipating User Needs, , New York: Neal-Schuman; Childers, T., (1984) Information and Referral, , Public libraries, Norwood, NJ: Ablex; Cisler, S., Weatherproofing a great, good place (1996) American Libraries, 27 (9), pp. 42-46; Dervin, B., From the mind's eye of the user: The sense-making qualitative-quantitative methodology (1992) Qualitative Research in Information Management, pp. 61-84. , In J.D.

The main factors that affect these kinds of efforts are more human and attitudinal than technological or economical. The information environment today is very much conducive enough to tackle the problems faced earlier. With the advent of the Internet and World Wide Web, it is possible to provide instantaneous access to the sources available not only within the organization, but other institutions that participate in the consortia programme. This paper provides a framework for the design and development of an intranet model based on a consortia approach. This model will facilitate information access and use by providing a single Web-enabled window to the information users of the participating institutions in the consortia programme not only to their own resources but sources in the other institutions as well. This will bridge the gap between information resource rich and information deficient libraries and will enhance the information base, shared access and optimum utilization of information resources at an affordable cost.","Cost effectiveness; India; Information technology strategy; Library management; Partnering","Computer hardware; Cost effectiveness; Information management; Information technology; Intranets; World Wide Web; Intranet models; Digital libraries","Fox, E.A., Digital libraries (1995) Communications of the ACM, 38 (4), pp. 23-28. , April; Ranganathan, S.R., (1963) Five Laws of Library Science, , Asia Publishing House, Bombay",Article,Scopus

By examining models of the scholarly communication circuit of scientists developed in communication science, and models of information flow developed in the fields of library and information science, bottle-necks in the flow of information between scholars can be identified and possible solutions to underlying problems can be considered. Significant potential bottlenecks to the flow of information become especially evident upon close examination of certain key roles of the scientific literature in the scholarly work of scientists. By considering the essential types of information that scientific literature is meant to communicate, and by examining strengths and weaknesses of the scholarly communication circuit in communicating that information, information specialists can consider alternative and more effective approaches to meeting the scholarly information needs of scientists. Examination of such issues as the role of scientific documents in social processes of scientific scholarship, the problems associated with how meaning is represented by documents, the problems associated with the fragmentation of scientific literature as a result of the growth of literature, and the difficulties associated with the use of information retrieval systems, highlight the serious limitations of the scholarly communication circuit, irrespective of the use of advanced information technology. Implications of these issues for the librarian and the scientific scholar are discussed. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

As described in the recent book The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure, this Grid will connect the nation's computers, databases, instruments, and people in a seamless web of computing and distributed intelligence, which can be used in an on-demand fashion as a problem-solving resource in many fields of human endeavor-and, in particular, science and engineering. The availability of grid resources will give rise to dramatically new classes of applications, in which computing resources are no longer localized but, rather, distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic; computation is increasingly sophisticated and multidisciplinary; and computation is integrated into our daily lives and, hence, subject to stricter time constraints than at present. The impact of these new applications will be pervasive, ranging from new systems for scientific inquiry, through computing support for crisis management, to the use of ambient computing to enhance personal mobile computing environments. To realize this vision, significant scientific and technical obstacles must be overcome. Principal among these is usability. The goal of the Grid Application Development Software (GrADS) project is to simplify distributed heterogeneous computing in the same way that the World Wide Web simplified information sharing over the Internet. To that end, the project is exploring the scientific and technical problems that must be solved to make it easier for ordinary scientific users to develop, execute, and tune applications on the Grid.

Technical difficulties, however, still remain in the field of displaying and printing text. Windowing systems and printers often lack support for scripts that are not widely used and there has been no simple and flexible remedy for this problem. In this paper, we describe the general font module VFlib for multilingual text. VFlib knows how fonts are represented in different font formats and obtains glyphs as bitmap images from various font files. As VFlib provides a unified interface for font access, application programs can employ many font types without handling their details. We have also implemented previewers and printer drivers that use VFlib as the font retrieval module. These application programs include a program named ps-multi that prints multi-script text created with the multilingual text editor Emacs version 20 or later. From our experiences of implementing these application programs, we believe that VFlib is a simple and powerful solution for multi-script text printing and displaying.","Computer typography; Fonts; GNU Emacs; Mule; Multilingual information processing; VFlib","Algorithms; C (programming language); Client server computer systems; Data processing; Database systems; Digital libraries; Encoding (symbols); Graphical user interfaces; Printers (computer); Program interpreters; Text processing; UNIX; Application programs; Computer typography; Font module; Multilingual information processing; Multiscript text printing; File editors","The unicode consortium.

The architecture proposes the use of system components with standard public interfaces for implementing retrieval functionality. The standardization of the components and their encapsulation in autonomous software agents result in functional stratification and easy extensibility. Collaboration of the independent retrieval resources in ImAge results in enhanced system capability. Reuse of existing retrieval resources is achieved by encapsulating them in agents with standard interfaces. The addition of independent agents with domain knowledege adds the capability of processing conceptual queries, while reusing the existing system components for feature-based retrieval. A communication protocol allows the declaration of the capabilities of the system components and negotiations for optimal resource selection for solving a retrieval problem. The use of mobile agents alleviates network bottlenecks.

Quality electronic teaching and research resources, which are of significant value or potential value to academics, universities and the UK Higher Education community in general, are being created at high levels in all types of university. However, since they are not being created with the aim of wider access and use, few are networked, most are difficult to find or in difficult to access electronic formats, and consequently are unlikely to be suitable for reuse by other institutions or even other departments in the host institution. There can also be other problems such as a lack of clarity on the copyright position of resources on university Web sites and a failure to protect potentially valuable university resources from copyright infringement. University management of services offering access to these resources within and beyond the host institution would greatly improve the value that both the host institution and UK Higher Education as a whole obtain from this material and the effort that goes into creating it - particularly if local efforts were co-ordinated nationally to ensure resource design standardisation and service interoperability. Universities appear to regard the issue as important and see the advantages of managing services as outweighing the disadvantages. Most institutions appear to envisage University Libraries playing a key role in the management of services.",,"Information analysis; Information management; Information services; Teaching; Websites; Electronic resources; Electronic teaching; Digital libraries","catriona2.lib.strath.ac.uk/catrionawww.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elibwww.lib.strath.ac.ukwww.napier.ac.uk/depts/libhome.htmlbubl.ac.uk/org/scurlW269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/all-q.htmlwp269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/surveys.html#SECT8, wp269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/catconts.htmSee outline remit: Wp269.lib.strath.ac.uk/starweb/dio.html - use usernameguest and password tem- porary to accesswp269.lib.strath.ac.uk:5050/Cat2/issues.html",Article,Scopus

In applications such as database retrieval, it is important that image features used in pattern comparison provide good measures of image perceptual similarities. In this paper, we present an image model with a new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model is based on the 2D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described as ""periodicity ""directionality and ""randomness,"" approximating what are indicated to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented here improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety of local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The effectiveness of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure o; pattern similarity while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented. ©1996 IEEE.","Content-based image retrieval; Digital libraries; Pattern analysis; Texture modeling; Wold-based image modeling","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Database systems; Image analysis; Information retrieval; Probability; Digital libraries; Image model; Image retrieval; Perceptual similarity; Two dimensional Wold decomposition; Wold texture modeling; Feature extraction","Kao, A.K., Towards a Texture Naming System: Identifying Relevant Dimensions of Texture/' Proc.

In this paper, we present an image database in which images are indexed and retrieved based on color histograms. We first address the problems inherent in color histograms created by the conventional method, and then propose a new method to create histograms which are compact in size and insensitive to minor illumination variations such as highlight, shape, and etc. A powerful indexing scheme where each histogram of an image is encoded into a numerical key, and stored in a two-layered tree structure is introduced. This approach turns the problem of histogram matching, which is computation intensive, into index key search, so as to realize quick data access in a large scale image database. Two types of user interfaces, Query by user provided sample images, and Query by combination of the system provided templates, are provided to meet various user requests. Various experimental evaluations exhibit the effectiveness of the image database system. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Color image processing; Content based image retrieval; Digital libraries; Image database","Color image processing; Data structures; Indexing (of information); Information retrieval systems; Information technology; User interfaces; Color histograms; Content based image retrieval; Digital libraries; Image database system; Image indexing; Image retrieval; Multimedia; Database systems","Gong, Y.H., Sakauchi, M., A Method of Detecting Regions with Specified Chromatic Features (1993) ACCV'93, , Japan; Gong, Y.H., Zhang, H., Chua, H.C., Sakauchi, M., An Image Database System with Content Capturing and Fast Image Indexing Abilities (1994) IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems, , Boston; Kato, T., Kurita, T., Shimogaki, H., Intelligent Visual Interaction with Image Database Systems - Toward the Multimedia Personal Interface (1991) Journal of Information Processing of Japan, 14 (2), pp. 134-143; McFadden, F.R., Hoffer, J.A., Srinivasan, (1988) Database Management, , Cummings, Inc, 3rd Edition; Miyahara, M., Yoshida, Y., Mathematical Transform of (R, G, B) Color Data to Munsell (H, V, C) Color Data (1989) Journal of the Institute of Television Engineers, Japan, 43 (10), pp. 1129-1136; Niblack, W., Barber, R., Equitz, W., The QBIC Project: Querying Images by Content Using Color, Texture, and Shape (1993) SPIE, 1908; Swain, M.J., Interactive Indexing into Image Databases (1993) SPIE, 1908; Swain, M.J., Bollard, D.H., Color Indexing (1991) International Journal of Computer Vision, 7 (1); Tseng, D.C., Chang, C.H., Color Segmentation Using Perceptual Attributes (1992) Llth IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, , Netherlands, Sept",Article,Scopus

Roughly, a Coollist is equivalent to a Hotlist in Mosaic except that it automatically records all the visited HTML document titles by default. Thus, in theory, by maintaining a merged list of everybody's Coollists, a complete index of all the HTML files in the Web should be created eventually. In practice, even if transferring everybody's Coollists to a single site were feasible, the growth and change rate of Web questions us whether the archie metaphor of ""every index server maintains all the know-wheres"" could be applied to the rest of the Web. The new metaphor we are suggesting is a library metaphor. Let each organization maintain the merged Coollists of their individuals. If some organization has surplus computing resources, let it maintain the merged list of other merged lists. This way, individuals are likely to find documents of their interest from their own organization. But organizations have characteristics like libraries have specialities. Therefore, individuals will find other interesting documents from its ""neighboring"" sites. Bigger libraries carry more books. Likewise, there will be sites that merge many merged lists together which will be useful for blind keyword searching of the titles. For our current implementation of a Coollist, we take advantage of CERN proxy-cache server to collect the indices of all the visited HTML files. People on three of the 19 plants within the company tried the merged list of Coollists and found it almost indispensable. People who used to save almost every URLs they visited and those who wanted some comprehensive list of URLs found it particularly useful. In the paper, we describe the result of our experiment in detail and also point out how our approach might solve the scaleability problem of other Web indexing solutions. © 1995.","Digital library; HTML documents; Information clustering; Information retrieval; Searching",,,Article,Scopus
