Design/methodology/approach - Terms are selected from the Art & Architecture Thesaurus developed by Getty Research Institute in the USA (source language) and the National Palace Museum in Taiwan participating in Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program (target language). In respect of data analysis, mapping analysis and content analysis are both adopted. Findings - Among the six types of term equivalence, ""exact equivalence"" appears most frequently. The degree of similarity between different conceptual structures can be divided into four types: similar structure, transferring part of the structure of source language into the system of target language by modeling; similar structure, but the structure of source language needs to be expanded or revised; dissimilar structure, the term in target language can be partially mapped to the term in source language; lack of structure, no matches between target language and source language. Practical implications - The next step is to develop a more comprehensive conceptual structure that can incorporate multicultural perspectives. If the ""partial equivalence"" terms are further identified as important concepts, the problems of non-exact equivalence terms and dissimilar conceptual structures can be solved by addressing the needs of English users in searching for Chinese art collections. Originality/value - The study serves as a pilot study applicable to the development of multilingual KOS in the domain of Chinese fine arts, building the first demonstration model for the interoperability of KOS in Chinese and English. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Arts; Classification; Digital libraries; Indexing; Languages",,"Baca, M., The Getty Vocabularies and issues in building multilingual thesauri (2009) TELDAP International Conference, Taipei; Chaplan, M.A., Mapping Laborline thesaurus terms to Library of Congress subject headings: Implications for vocabulary switching (1995) Library Quarterly, 56 (1), pp. 39-61; Chen, S.J., Chinese-language art & architecture thesaurus: Methods and issues (2009) CIDOC 2009, Santiago, 29 September; Doerr, M., Semantic problems of thesaurus mapping (2001) Journal of Digital Information, 1 (8). , http://jodi/ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v01/i08/Doerr/; Harpring, P., (2010) Art & Architecture Thesaurus: Editorial Guidelines, , www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ editorial_guidelines.html#aat, J.

The need to transform the data from a flat schema to a full-fledged ontology arose during preliminary works in the Polish research project SYNAT. The Digital Libraries Federation site offers aggregated metadata of more than 600,000 publications that constitute the first portion of data introduced into the Integrated Knowledge System - one of the services developed in the SYNAT project. To be able to perform the desired functions, IKS needs heavily linked data that can be searched semantically. The issue is not only one of mapping one schema element to another, as the conceptualization of CIDOC is significantly different from that of the DLF schema. In the paper we identify a number of problems that are common to all such transformations and propose solutions. Finally, we present statistics concerning the mapping process and the resulting knowledge base. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.","CIDOC CRM; digital libraries; metadata; ontologies; RDF repositories; semantic web; thesauri",,"Atkins, A., Fox, E., France, R., Suleman, H., (2008) ETD-MS: An Interoperability Metadata Standard for Electronic Theses and Dissertations, 1.2 Edn, , http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etd-ms-v1.00-rev2.html; Bishop, B., Kiryakov, A., Ognyanoff, D., Peikov, I., Tashev, Z., Velkov, R., OWLIM: A family of scalable semantic repositories (2010) Semantic Web - Interoperability, Usability, , http://www.semantic-web-journal.net, Applicability; Clayphan, R., (2011) Europeana Semantic Elements Specification, Version 3.3.1, , https://version1.europeana.eu/c/document-library/get-file?uuid= a830cb84-9e71-41d6-9ca3-cc36415d16f8&groupId=10602, January 24; Crofts, N., Doerr, M., Gill, T., Stead, S., Stiff, M., (2005) Definition of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, 5.0.2 Edn, , http://www.cidoc-crm.org/docs/cidoc-crm-version-5.0.2.pdf, June; Daćko, D., Józefowska, J., Lawrynowicz, A., An ontology based semantic library catalogue (2007) Proceeding of the 3rd Language & Technology Conference, Poznań, pp. 109-113; Derwojedowa, M., Piasecki, M., Szpakowicz, S., Zawisławska, M., Polish WordNet on a Shoestring (2007) Proceedings of Biannual Conference of the Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology, pp. 169-178. , Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, April 11-13; Doerr, M., (2000) Mapping of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set to the CIDOC CRM, , http://www.cidoc-crm.org/docs/dc-to-crm-mapping.pdf, Technical Report, 274, ICS-FORTH, Heraklion, Crete (July); Dudczak, A., Heliński, M., Mazurek, C., Mielnicki, M., Werla, M., Extending the Shibboleth Identity Management Model with a Networked User Profile (2008) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 179-182. , Gdańsk, May 18-21; Fellbaum, C., Word net (1998) An Electronic Lexical Database, , MIT Press; Gill, T., Building semantic bridges between museums, libraries and archives: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (2004) First Monday, 9 (5). , http://firstmonday.org; Görz, G., Oischinger, M., Schiemann, B., An implementation of the CIDOC conceptual reference model (4.2.4) in OWL-DL (2008) Proceedings of CIDOC 2008 - The Digital Curation of Cultural Heritage, , ICOM CIDOC, Athens; Hohmann, G., Scholz, M., Recommendation for the Representation of the Primitive Value Classes of the CRM As Data Types in RDF/OWL Implementations, , http://erlangen-crm.org/docs/crm-values-as-owl-datatypes.pdf; Kakali, K., Doerr, M., Papatheodorou, C., Stasinopoulou, T., (2007) Wp5 - Task 5.5 Dc.type Mapping to Cidoc/crm, , Technical report.

Design/methodology/approach: Text mining techniques were used to identify duplicate references. Moreover, the process of identifying syntactically different data was improved with the automated discovery of thesauri from correctly matched data, and the generated thesaurus was further used in semantic clustering. The results were effectively visually represented. Findings: The paper finds that the function based on the Jaro-Winkler algorithm may be efficiently used in the de-duplication process. A generated thesaurus that utilises domain-specific knowledge can also be used in the semantic clustering of references. It was shown that semantic clustering may be most useful in partitioning data, which is particularly significant when dealing with large amounts of data, which is usually the case. Moreover, those references that have the same or similar scores may be considered as candidate matches in the further de-duplication process. Finally, it proved to be a more efficient way of visually representing the results.

It can also be considered as a universal digital library interconnecting digital libraries in multiple domains and languages. Beside the advance of information technology, the global economy has also accelerated the development of inter-organizational information systems. Managing knowledge obtained in multilingual information systems from multiple geographical regions is an essential component in the contemporary inter-organization information systems. An organization cannot claim itself to be a global organization unless it is capable to overcome the cultural and language barriers in their knowledge management. Cross-lingual semantic interoperability is a challenge in multilingual knowledge management systems. Dictionary is a tool that is widely utilized in commercial systems to cross the language barrier. However, terms available in dictionary are always limited. As language is evolving, there are new words being created from time to time. For examples, there are new technical terms and name entities such as RFID and Baidu. To solve the problem of cross-lingual semantic interoperability, an associative constraint network approach is investigated to construct an automatic cross-lingual thesaurus. In this work, we have investigated the backmarking algorithm and the forward evaluation algorithm to resolve the constraint satisfaction problem represented by the associative constraint network. Experiments have been conducted and show that the forward evaluation algorithm outperforms the backmarking one in terms of precision and recall but the backmarking algorithm is more efficient than the forward evaluation algorithm. We have also benchmarked with our earlier technique, Hopfield network, and showed that the associate constraint network (either backmarking or forward evaluation) outperforms in precision, recall, and efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a simple approach for aiding reuse in software development using object-oriented library. Our approach improves the effectiveness of code searching by reorganizing the library with facet classification scheme and thesaurus.

We approach this problem from the perspective that a new searching mechanism, specialized in the juridical area, will work better than standard solutions. We propose a specialized (or vertical) searching mechanism that combines information from a juridical thesaurus with information generated by a standard searching mechanism (the classic vector space model), using the framework of a Bayesian belief network. Our vertical searching mechanism is evaluated using a reference collection of 552,573 documents. The results show improvements in retrieval performance, suggesting that the study and development of vertical searching mechanisms is a promising research direction. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.","Digital library; Juridical area; Ranking; Thesaurus; Vertical searching",,"Gilchrist, A., (1971) The Thesaurus in Retrieval, , Aslib, London; Greenberg, J., Automatic query expansion via lexical-semantic relationships (2001) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 52 (5), pp. 402-415; Greenberg, J., Optimal query expansion (QE) processing methods with semantically encoded structured thesauri terminology (2001) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 52 (6), pp. 487-1198; (2002), http://www.cjf.gov.brKristensen, J., Expanding end-users' query statements for free text searching with a search-aid thesaurus (1993) Information Processing & Management, 29 (6), pp. 733-744; Lancaster, F.W., (1991) Indexing and Abstracting in Theory and Practice, , Library Association Publishing, London; Mandala, R., Tokunaga, T., Tanaka, H., Query expansion using heterogeneous thesauri (2000) Information Processing & Management, 36 (2000), pp. 361-378; (2002), http://www.trf1.gov.br(2002), http://www.stj.gov.brPearl, J., (1988) Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems, , Morgan Kaufmann, Los Altos, California; Qiu, Y., Frei, H.P., Concept based query expansion (1993) Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 160-169; Ribeiro-Neto, B., Muntz, R.R., A belief network model for IR (1996) ACM Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR96, pp. 253-260; Ribeiro-Neto, B., Silva, I., Muntz, R., Bayesian network models for IR (2000) Soft Computing in Information Retrieval Techniques and Applications, pp. 259-291. , Fabio Crestani and Gabriella Pasi, editors, Springer Verlag; Salton, G., McGill, M.J., (1983) Introduction to Modern Information Retrieval, , McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York; Shiri, A.A., Revie, C., Thesauri on the web: Current developments and trends (2000) Online Information Review, 24 (4), pp. 273-279; Silva, I., Ribeiro-Neto, B., Calado, P., Moura, E., Ziviani, N., Link-based and content-based evidential information in a belief network model (2000) ACM Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR2000, pp. 96-103. , Best Student paper; (2002), http://www.stf.gov.brVoorhees, E.M., Harman, D., Overview of the fifth Text REtrieval Conference (1996) Proceedings of the Fifth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-5), pp. 1-28. , National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899",Article,Scopus

According to a report from Computer Economics in 1999, 54% of Internet users are English speakers (""English Will Dominate Web for Only Three More Years,"" Computer Economics, July 9, 1999, http://www.computereconomics.com/new4/pr/pr990610.html). However, it is predicted that there will be only 60% increase in Internet users among English speakers verses a 150% growth among non-English speakers for the next five years. By 2005, 57% of Internet users will be non-English speakers. A report by CNN.com in 2000 showed that the number of Internet users in China had been increased from 8.9 million to 16.9 million from January to June in 2000 (""Report: China Internet users double to 17 million,"" CNN.com, July, 2000, http://cnn.org/2000/TECH/computing/07/27/china.internet.reut/index.html). According to Nielsen/NetRatings, there was a dramatic leap from 22.5 millions to 56.6 millions Internet users from 2001 to 2002. China had become the second largest global at-home Internet population in 2002 (US's Internet population was 166 millions) (Robyn Greenspan, ""China Pulls Ahead of Japan,"" Internet.com, April 22, 2002, http://cyberatlas.internet.com/big_picture/geographics/article/0,,5911_1013841,0 0.html). All of the evidences reveal the importance of crosslingual research to satisfy the needs in the near future. Digital library research has been focusing in structural and semantic interoperability in the past. Searching and retrieving objects across variations in protocols, formats and disciplines are widely explored (Schatz, B., & Chen, H. (1999). Digital libraries: technological advances and social impacts. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, February, 32(2), 45-50.; Chen, H., Yen, J., & Yang, C.C. (1999). International activities: development of Asian digital libraries. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, 32(2), 48-49). However, research in crossing language boundaries, especially across European languages and Oriental languages, is still in the initial stage. In this proposal, we put our focus on cross-lingual semantic interoperability by developing automatic generation of a cross-lingual thesaurus based on English/Chinese parallel corpus. When the searchers encounter retrieval problems, professional librarians usually consult the thesaurus to identify other relevant vocabularies. In the problem of searching across language boundaries, a cross-lingual thesaurus, which is generated by co-occurrence analysis and Hopfield network, can be used to generate additional semantically relevant terms that cannot be obtained from dictionary. In particular, the automatically generated cross-lingual thesaurus is able to capture the unknown words that do not exist in a dictionary, such as names of persons, organizations, and events. Due to Hong Kong's unique history background, both English and Chinese are used as official languages in all legal documents. Therefore, English/Chinese cross-lingual information retrieval is critical for applications in courts and the government. In this paper, we develop an automatic thesaurus by the Hopfield network based on a parallel corpus collected from the Web site of the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Experiments are conducted to measure the precision and recall of the automatic generated English/Chinese thesaurus. The result shows that such thesaurus is a promising tool to retrieve relevant terms, especially in the language that is not the same as the input term. The direct translation of the input term can also be retrieved in most of the cases.",,"Digital libraries; Information retrieval; Interoperability; Network protocols; Query languages; Search engines; Semantics; Thesauri; User interfaces; Chinese thesaurus; English thesaurus; Hopfield network; Parallel Corpus laws; World Wide Web","English will dominate web for only three more years (1999) Computer Economics, , July 9; PRIVATE HREF=""http://www.computereconomics.com/new4/pr/pr990610.html"" MACROBUTTON HtmlResAnchor http://www.computereconomics.com/new4/pr/pr990610.html; Report: China internet users double to 17 million (2000), CNN.com, July; PRIVATE HREF=""http://cnn.org/2000/TECH/computing/07/27/china.internet.reut/index.ht ml"" MACROBUTTON HtmlResAnchor http://cnn.org/2000/TECH/computing/07/27/china.internet.reut/index.htmlGreenspan, R., China pulls ahead of Japan (2002), http://cyberatlas.internet.com/big_picture/geographics/article/0,5911_10 13841.00.html, April 22, 2002Ballesteros, L., Crosft, B., Phrasal translation and query expansion techniques for cross-language information retrieval (1997) Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR, 1997, pp. 84-91; Chen, H., Artificial intelligence techniques for emerging information systems applications: Trailblazing path to semantic interoperability (1998) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49 (7), pp. 579-581; Chien, L.F., PAT-tree-based keyword extraction for Chinese information retrieval (1997) Proceedings of ACM SIGIR, pp. 50-58. , Philadelphia, PA, 1997; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 37-46; Dai, Y., Khoo, C., Loh, T., A new statistical formula for Chinese text segmentation incorporating contextual information (1999) Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR, pp. 82-89. , Berkeley, CA.

In a digital library, however, the goal is to not involve people, and so queries which eliminate precision problems in query results are in demand as a replacement for the librarian. In current retrieval systems, precision is improved by using a hierarchical method such as synonym notation processing. In methods based on word systems, processing to handle the inadequate expression of the intention of a query or the semantic interpretation of a query are insufficient, and information retrieval from a more hierarchical perspective is needed. In this paper the authors propose a retrieval method using a hierarchical perspective based on a system of concepts, and not a retrieval method based on conventional word systems. By adopting the EDR electronic dictionary as a thesaurus and using concept information, queries and words which appear in papers are not processed merely as character strings, but are used in queries with consideration for the meaning of the words. The authors' method can estimate imprecise information in the intentions of queries and the meaning hidden in words, allowing for appropriate query results to be provided to users without the cooperation of a librarian.","Concept paths; Digital library; Index words; Information retrieval; Query","Computer simulation; Data structures; Digital libraries; Feature extraction; Indexing (of information); Optical character recognition; Query languages; Semantics; Thesauri; Concept paths; Electronic dictionary; Index words; Information retrieval","(1997) NAIST Electronic Library Report, '97, , http://dlw3.aist-nara.ac.jp, The Electronic Library at the Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology; Graduate School, Nara Institute of Science and Technology; Morobashi, M., Tsutsui, Y., Maruyama, H., Nomiyama, H., A proposal for effective navigation functions in an information retrieval system (1994) Digital Library Workshop, (2), pp. 45-49. , Nov; Lim, C., Chen, H., An automatic indexing and neural network approach to concept retrieval and classification of multilingual (Chinese-English) documents (1994) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern; Salton, G., Allen, J., Buckley, C., Automatic structuring and retrieval of large text files (1994) Commun ACM, 37, pp. 94-108; Yokoi, T., Kimura, K., Koizumi, A., Mitsuyoshi, H., Information structure in an electronic dictionary in hierarchical levels (1996) Trans Inf Process Soc, 37, pp. 333-343. , (in Japanese); Gorden, M., Probabilistic and genetic algorithms for document retrieval (1988) Commun ACM, 31, pp. 1208-1218; Allean, J., Relevance feedback with too much data (1995) 18th ACM SIGIR Conference on Information Retrieval, pp. 337-343; Xu, J., Croft, W.B., Query expansion using local and global document analysis (1996) 19th Annual Int ACM SIGIR Conf on R&D in Information Retrieval, pp. 4-11; Harter, S.P., A probabilistic approach to automatic keyword indexing.

Using a variation of the automatic thesaurus generation techniques, to which we refer as the concept space approach, we aimed to create graphs of domain-specific concepts (terms) and their weighted co-occurrence relationships for all major engineering domains. Merging these concept spaces and providing traversal paths across different concept spaces could potentially help alleviate the vocabulary (difference) problem evident in large-scale information retrieval. We have experimented previously with such a technique for a smaller molecular biology domain (Worm Community System, with 10+ MBs of document collection) with encouraging results. In order to address Ihe scalability issue related to large-scale information retrieval and analysis for the current Illinois DLI project, we recently conducted experiments using the concept space approach on parallel supercomputers. Our test collection included 2+ GBs of computer science and electrical engineering abstracts extracted from the INSPEC database. The concept space approach called for extensive textual and statistical analysis (a form of knowledge discovery) based on automatic indexing and cooccurrence analysis algorithms, both previously tested in the biology domain. Initial testing results using a 512-node CM-5 and a 16processor SGI Power Challenge were promising. Power Challenge was later selected to create a comprehensive computer engineering concept space of about 270,000 terms and 4,000,000+ links using 24.5 hours of CPU time. Our system evaluation involving 12 knowledgeable subjects revealed that the automatically-created computer engineering concept space generated significantly higher concept recall than the human-generated INSPEC computer engineering thesaurus. However, the INSPEC was more precise than the automatic concept space. Our current work mainly involves creating concept spaces for other major engineering domains and developing robust graph matching and traversal algorithms for cross-domain, concept-based retrieval. Future work also will include generating individualized concept spaces for assisting user-specific concept-based information retrieval. © 1996 IEEE.","Concept association; Concept space; Digital library; Parallel computing; Semantic retrieval","Algorithms; Data reduction; Database systems; Indexing (of information); Parallel processing systems; Statistical methods; Supercomputers; Concept association; Concept space approach; Digital library; Semantic retrieval; Information retrieval","Ahlswede, T., Evens, M., ""Generating a Relational Lexicon from a Machine-Readable Dictionary Int 7 J.
