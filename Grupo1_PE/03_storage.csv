Design/methodology/approach: MyAIS is supported by an IBM HS22V multiple blade server using virtualization technology. A single blade server runs both MyAIS's back-end that handles the processing of digital repository and front-end that handles the web server. The whole system runs on a Linux platform. The virtualized servers deliver an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Malaya researchers as well as students. Findings: Sharing resources in the cloud cuts maintenance cost and leaves a smaller carbon footprint due to its modular design. Virtualization makes it easy to monitor access traffic and usage of hardware resources on-the-fly. The scalability and expansion of MyAIS is improved. It allows for faster system recovery in case of hard disk failure and speedy file move during migration. Larger bandwidth improves reliability and management of bottlenecks. Research limitations/implications: There are still bottlenecks at the wide area network level resulting in sluggishness during peak hours. Practical implications: There is significant improvement in storage expansion through shared hardware resources. Originality/value: Cloud as an IaaS helps reduce the total cost of ownership and maintenance, increase system scalability to handle increased traffic, meet increasing demand for storage space for full text resources, and reduce downtime. It makes backup and disaster recovery easier. It is possible to accommodate other university repositories in future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cloud computing; Digital libraries; Information systems; MyAIS; Open access repositories",,"Abrizah, A., Noorhidawati, A., Kiran, K., Global visibility of Asian universities' open access institutional repositories (2010) Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science, 15 (3), pp. 53-73; Barham, P., Dragovic, B., Fraser, K., Hand, S., Harris, T., Ho, A., Neugebauer, R., Warfield, A., Xen and the art of virtualization (2003) Proceedings. 19th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, Bolton, Landing, NY, USA, October 19, pp. 164-177; Bird, G., Ashoughian, G., All together now: Planning for shared print archiving at Canada's Western University (2012) Collection Management, 37 (3-4), pp. 260-270; Bugnion, E., Devine, S., Rosenblum, M., Sugerman, J., Wang, E.Y., Bringing virtualization to the x86 architecture with the original VMware workstation (2012) ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), 30 (4), pp. 1-51; Burton, G., Scholarly communication must be scalable (2010) Academic Evolution, , 20, February; Buyya, R., Yeo, C.S., Venugopal, S., Broberg, J., Brandic, I., Cloud computing and emerging IT platforms: Vision, hype, and reality for delivering computing as the 5th utility (2009) Future Generation Computer Systems, 25 (6), pp. 599-616; Christensen, H., HathiTrust: A research library at web scale (2011) Library Resources & Technical Services, 55 (2), pp. 93-102; Fox, R., Library in the cloud (2009) OCLC Systems & Services, 25 (3), pp. 156-161; Galvin, D., Sun, M., Avoiding the death zone: Choosing and running a library project in the cloud (2012) Library Hi Tech, 30 (3), pp. 418-427; (2012) Google Cloud Platform, , https://cloud.google.com, Google, available at; Kennan, M.A., Kingsley, D.A., The state of the nation: A snapshot of Australian institutional repositories (2009) First Monday, 14 (2). , http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2282, available at; Kim, J., (2006) Motivating and impeding factors affecting faculty contribution to institutional repositories, , www.ils.unc.edu/tibbo/JCDL2006/Kim-JCDLWorkshop2006.pdf, paper presented at Conference 2006, Chapel Hill, NC, 11-15 June, available at; Kroski, E., Library cloud atlas: A guide to cloud computing and storage/stacking the technology (2009) Library Journal, , www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6695772.html?q=kroski, September 10, available at; Kroski, E., Stacking the tech: The Library of Congress talks digital initiatives (2009) Library Journal, , www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6675049.html?q=kroski, August 6, available at; Malpas, C., (2010) Reconfiguring Academic Collections: The Role of Shared Print Repositories, , www.minitex.umn.edu/committees/mlac/Meetings/2011/Feb2011Malpas.pdf, available at, MLAC Advisory Board, Dublin, OH; Malpas, C., (2011) Cloud Sourcing Research Collections: Managing Print in the Mass-Digitized Library Environment, , www.oclc.org/resources/research/publications/library/2011/2011-01.pdf, available at, OCLC Research, Dublin, OH; Matsuura, K., (2008) Japan's institutional repositories where did they come from and where are they headed?, , Master's thesis, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; Mitchell, E., Using cloud services for library IT infrastructure (2010) Code [4] Lib Journal, (9), pp. 1-6. , http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/2510, available at; (2009) NIST.gov - Computer Security Division - Computer Security Centre, , http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/cloud-computing/index-html, NIST, available at; Nurnberg, P.J., Leggett, J.J., McFarland, S.M., Cloud as infrastructure at the Texas Digital Library (2012) Journal of Digital Information, 13 (1). , https://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/5881, available at; Pathy, S.C., Mahapatra, R.K., Cloud computing: Academic library in Orissa (2012) VSRD Technical & Non-Technical Journal, 3 (3), pp. 124-130; van Westrieneen, G., Lynch, C.A., Academic institutional repositories: Deployment status in 13 nations as of mid 2005 (2005) D-Lib Magazine, 11. , available at: doi:10.1045/September2005-westrienen; Zainab, A.N., Adding value to an abstracting and indexing system: The case of MyAIS (2012) Malaysia, World Digital Libraries, 5 (1), pp. 19-35; Zainab, A.N., Open access repositories and journals for visibility: Implications for Malaysian libraries (2010) Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science, 15 (3), pp. 97-119; Zuber, P.A., A study of institutional repository holdings by academic discipline (2008) DLib Magazine, 14 (11-12). , www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/11contents.html, available at",Article,Scopus

The full usage of digital libraries will be realized only when people can have access to the material from any location. The advantage of multimedia is that people of all ages can understand more clearly by seeing or hearing rather than reading. Considering the exponential growth in various technologies, developing a multimedia digital library in wireless is not an complicated task. Grid computing enables the virtualization data resources, process network bandwidth and storage capacities to create a single system image granting the user a seamless access to vast IT capabilities. By adopting peer-to-peer overlay networks, which are taking a central position in information systems, the storage space problem can be solved and by using grid computing the security can be maintained. In this article, we propose a framework for wireless multimedia digital library, built using Grid and P2P technology. Using this proposed framework, the digital data is stored in a cluster built of commodity components and users can access those data from anywhere, anytime securely. Advantages of this framework are: (i) existing capital investments are used for storing the multimedia files, (ii) increased access to data, (iii) balancing workloads among different systems connected in pGrid nodes, (iv) authenticated and secured transfer of files. Benchmarks used to test this framework are: (i) file size vs. download time, (ii) simultaneous connections, (iii) band-width utilization, (iv) security, (v) scalability, and (vi) robustness. © 2012 Arulanandam et al; licensee Springer licensee InTech.","Digital library; Grid computing; Multimedia data; Peer-to-peer networks; Wireless networks","Band-width utilization; Capital investment; Commodity components; Data resources; Digital datas; Download time; Exponential growth; File sizes; IT Capabilities; Multimedia data; Multimedia files; Peer-to-peer overlay networks; Process networks; Single system image; Storage capacity; Storage spaces; Virtualizations; Wireless multimedia; Audition; Digital storage; Grid computing; Investments; Wireless networks; Digital libraries","Fei, H., Almeida, N., Loureno, M., Trezentos, P., Borbinha, J.L., Neves, J., ARCO: A long-term digital library storage system based on grid computational infrastructure (2005) Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, 1, pp. 44-51. , Miami, USA, ISBN:972-8865-19-8; Foster, I., The anatomy of the Grid: Enabling scalable virtual organizations (2001) Lecture Notes in Computer Science; Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Nick, J., Tuecke, S., The physiology of the grid: Open grid services architecture for distributed system integration (2002) Article in Open Grid Service Infrastructure WG, , Global Grid Forum; Kubiatowicz, J., Bindel, D., Chen, Y., Czerwinski, S., Eaton, P., Geels, D., Gummadi, R., Zhao, B., OceanStore: An architecture for global-scale persistent storage (2000) International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS, pp. 190-201; Fox, E.A., Marchionini, G., Toward a worldwide digital library (1998) Commun.

This paper proposes an infrastructure, called PhotoGeo, which aims at helping users with the people photo annotation, event photo annotation, storage and retrieval of personal digital photos. To achieve the desired objective, PhotoGeo uses new algorithms that make it possible to annotate photos with the key metadata to facilitate their retrieval, such as: the people who were shown in the photo (who); where it was captured (where); the date and time of capture (when); and the event that was captured.

In conventional problem settings of distribution warehouses, stock items are stored in bulk but retrieved in small quantities. Storage assignment methods typically make use of demand attribute information of order quantity, order frequency and correlation between demands. In this paper, we address a different problem in which the request for the same stock items is stochastically recurrent. The problem arises when the items are needed in production and, after production, are returned to warehouses for later reuse. Examples of such items include tooling in factory, books in library and digital objects in data warehouses. Utilizing the recurrent characteristics, a salient recency-based storage assignment policy and an associated cascaded warehouse configuration are proposed and analyzed in this paper. This paper has four parts. In the first part, a model of recurrent demand is described. In the second part, the efficiency of the recency-based policy and a traditional ID-based policy is analyzed. In the third part, a mathematical programming model for optimal configuration of cascaded warehouses is presented. Finally, a case study of hospital visits is presented. This paper concludes with recommendations on cascading and zoning the warehouse for applying the recency-based policy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the age of cloud computing, which enables the use of online server storage space, this information could be used more effectively if it were digitized. However, digitizing filmbased radiographs and making them available for use in the cloud is not as easy as it seems. In order to address the issue of digitizing the film-based radiograph libraries in our radiology department, we looked at several options. The option that we chose was a consumergrade scanner, and this decision was based on price, resolution, shades of gray, built-in transparency function, and its physical attributes. Our goal was to digitize the film-based radiograph teaching files so they could be stored in a digital file locker such as Google Picassa for organization and quick access later. These files would constantly be updated in a Google document by residents, and this document would be called the ""Living Document"" based on its continuous expandability. This method would allow even the smallest radiology department to benefit from the use of modern technology to gain access to valuable information stored in film-based radiographs and give every resident the opportunity to benefit from it. © Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine 2011.","Clinical image viewing; Digital image management; Digital image processing; Digital imaging; Digital libraries; Digital radiography; Image libraries; Internet technology; Internship and residency; Radiography; Radiology teaching files; Teaching","article; computer network; forecasting; hospital information system; human; image quality; organization and management; radiology department; total quality management; United States; X ray film; Computer Communication Networks; Forecasting; Humans; Quality Improvement; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiology Department, Hospital; Radiology Information Systems; United States; X-Ray Film; Clinical image viewing; Digital image management; Digital imaging; Digital radiography; Image library; Internet technology; Internship and residency; Teaching files; Copying; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; Image processing; Radiation; Radiology; Teaching; Radiography","Davidson, H.C., Johnston, D.J., Christian, M.E., Harnsberger, H.R., Comparison of radiographic image quality from four digitization devices as viewed on computer monitors (2001) Journal of Digital Imaging, 14 (1), pp. 24-29; Christian, M.E., Davidson, H.C., Wiggins Iii, R.H., Berges, G., Cannon, G., Jackson, G., Chapman, B., Harnsberger, H.R., Digital processing of radiographic images from PACS to publishing (2001) Journal of Digital Imaging, 14 (1), pp. 14-17; Dzingle, D., May, G.A., Garland, H.T., Digital radiography and film scanners: Automating the transition to filmless radiology (2001) Journal of Digital Imaging, 14 (2 SUPPL. 1), pp. 128-130",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the literature on existing digital information preservation around the world, and then focuses on Latin American countries. It proposes a framework in which to analyze the situation in developing countries, particularly in Latin America, and summarizes the issues in six preservation factors and seven principles of preservation. Findings: The amount of digital information has increased geometrically without proper knowledge, theories, strategies, policies and proceedings to preserve it. Developed countries and regions have started to create this knowledge and know-how, as well as setting the basis to manage their digital collections within libraries, archives, and other organizations with the aim to preserve them in the long-term. The situation is radically different in Latin America where we found limited research and projects on digital preservation. Practical implications: The problem of the long-term authentic preservation of digital document collections is not a simple technology problem; it is a much more complex one. This paper summarizes the approaches to understand it but further study is required in order to develop a practical strategy and/or plan. It also highlights the importance of raising awareness of digital preservation in Latin America in order to ensure availability in the future. Social implications: Research, planning, initiatives and proper execution in regard to digital collections preservation is extremely limited in Latin American developing countries, thus endangering vast amounts of digital information. There is a serious risk that valuable digital information will not be preserved adequately for future generations. Originality/value: This paper reviews the main challenges for libraries and archives to preserve digital information over the long term and summarizes the main issues to understand and to thwart this problem. It also highlights the often overlooked problem of digital preservation in developing countries, in particular Latin America. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital archives Long-term preservation; Digital information; Digital libraries; Information preservation","Current situation; Design/methodology/approach; Developed countries; Digital collections; Digital Documents; Digital information; Digital preservation; Future generations; Information preservation; Know-how; Latin America; Latin americans; Long-term preservation; SIMPLE technology; Social implication; Developing countries; Digital image storage; Technology transfer; Digital libraries","Beagrie, N., (2003) National Digital Preservation Initiatives: An Overview of Developments in Australia, France, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom and of Related International Activity: Commissioned for and Sponsored by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program, Library of Congress, , www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub116/pub116.pdf, April, available at, Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), Washington, DC; Bohn, R., Short, J., (2009) How Much Information 2009: Report on American Consumers, , http://hmi.ucsd.edu/pdf/HMI_2009_ConsumerReport_Dec9_2009.pdf, December 9, available at, Global Information Industry Center, University of California at San Diego, San Diego, CA; Preservation initiatives (2006) The Global Digital Format Registry, , www.diglib.org/preserve.htm#initiatives, Digital Libraries Federation, available at; Duranti, L., (2005) La Conservación a Largo Plazo De Documentos electrónicos auténticos: Hallazgos Del Proyecto Interpares, , (Tendencias; 4), Concejalía de Cultura: 3000, Cartagena; (2006) International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems.

This paper aims to discuss three interrelated aspects of preserving plagiarized works: collection development issues, copyright problems, and technological requirements. Too often these three are handled separately even though in fact each has an influence on the other. Design/methodology/approach: The paper looks first at the ingest process (called the Submission Information Package or SIP), then at storage management in the archive (the AIP or Archival Information Package), and finally at the retrieval process (the DIP or Distribution Information Package). Findings: The chief argument of this paper is that works of plagiarism and the evidence exposing them are complex objects, technically, legally and culturally. Merely treating them like any other work needing preservation runs the risk of encountering problems on one of those three fronts. Practical implications: This is a problem, since currently many public preservation strategies focus on ingesting large amounts of self-contained content that resembles print on paper, rather than on online works that need special handling. Archival systems also often deliberately ignore the cultural issues that affect future usability. Originality/value: The paper discusses special handling and special considerations for archiving works of plagiarism. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Archiving; Collections management; Digital libraries; Digital preservation; Germany; Intellectual property; Plagiarism; Preservation",,"(2002) Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS), , http://ddp.nist.gov/refs/oais.pdf, CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems), available at, (accessed September 2011), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington DC; (2011) Uni Osnabrück Warnt Vor Guttenbergs Dissertation, , www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12744712/Uni-Osnabrueck-warnt-vor-Guttenbergs-Dissertation.html, Online Die Welt, 9 March, available at, (accessed September); Freiherr zu Guttenberg, K.-T., (2009) Verfassung Und Verfassungsvertrag: Konstitutionelle Entwicklungsstufen in Den USA Und Der EU, , Dunker & Humblot, Berlin; von Darnstädt, T., (2011) Doctor Der Reserve, Der Spiegel, , www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-77108483.html, 21 February, available at, (September)",Article,Scopus

To attack the challenge, several machine learning techniques have been developed and applied for automated photo tagging. For example, supervised learning techniques have been applied to automated photo tagging by training statistical classifiers from a collection of manually labeled examples. Although the existing approaches work well for small testbeds with relatively small number of annotation words, due to the long-standing challenge of object recognition, they often perform poorly in large-scale problems. Another limitation of the existing approaches is that they require a set of high-quality labeled data, which is not only expensive to collect but also time consuming. In this article, we investigate a social image based annotation scheme by exploiting implicit side information that is available for a large number of social photos from the social web sites. The key challenge of our intelligent annotation scheme is how to learn an effective distance metric based on implicit side information (visual or textual) of social photos. To this end, we present a novel ""Probabilistic Distance Metric Learning"" (PDML) framework, which can learn optimized metrics by effectively exploiting the implicit side information vastly available on the social web. We apply the proposed technique to photo annotation tasks based on a large social image testbed with over 1 million tagged photos crawled from a social photo sharing portal. Encouraging results show that the proposed technique is effective and promising for social photo based annotation tasks. © 2011.","Automated photo tagging; Content-based image retrieval; Distance metric learning; Social images; Uncertain side information","Automated photo tagging; Content based image retrieval; Distance Metric Learning; Social images; Uncertain side information; Automation; Classification (of information); Content based retrieval; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Information management; Learning algorithms; Object recognition; Supervised learning; Test facilities; Testbeds; Computer graphics","Andoni, A., Indyk, P., Near-Optimal hashing algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor in high dimensions (2008) Comm.

The existing highly robust watermark algorithms are applying ""detectable watermarks"" for which a detection mechanism checks if the watermark exists or not (a Boolean decision) based on a watermarking key. The problem is that the detection of a watermark in a digital image library containing thousands of images means that the watermark detection algorithm is necessary to apply all the keys to the digital images. This application is non-efficient for very large image databases. On the other hand ""readable"" watermarks may prove weaker but easier to detect as only the detection mechanism is required. The proposed watermarking algorithm combine's the advantages of both ""detectable"" and ""readable"" watermarks. The result is a fast and robust multimedia application which has the ability to cast readable multibit watermarks into digital images. The watermarking application is capable of hiding 214 different keys into digital images and casting multiple zero-bit watermarks onto the same coefficient area while maintaining a sufficient level of robustness. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Content based image retrieval; Digital images; Spread spectrum analysis; Subband-DCT; Watermarking; Wavelet domain","Content based image retrieval; Digital image; Spread spectrum analysis; Sub-bands; Subband-DCT; Wavelet domain; Algorithms; Content based retrieval; Cosine transforms; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; Digital watermarking; Discrete cosine transforms; Image processing; Information retrieval; Interferometry; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Spectrum analyzers; Wavelet transforms; Watermarking","Barni, M., Bartolini, F., Cappellini, V., Piva, A., A DCT-domain system for robust image watermarking (1998) Signal Processing, ""special Issue on Watermarking"", 66 (3), pp. 357-372. , 0907.68070; (1999) The Digital Dilemma: Intellectual Property in the Information Age, pp. 2-3. , Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, National Research Council.

In spite of this rapid growth, users experience high levels of frustration when searching for the desired image. Even though new images are profitable to the service providers, traditional collaborative filtering methods cannot recommend them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose feature-based collaborative filtering (FBCF) method to reflect the user's most recent preference by representing his purchase sequence in the visual feature space. The proposed approach represents the images that have been purchased in the past as the feature clusters in the multi-dimensional feature space and then selects neighbors by using an inter-cluster distance function between their feature clusters. Various experiments using real image data demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a higher quality recommendation and better performance than do typical collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. © 2009 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Collaborative filtering; Feature clustering; Image segmentation; Recommendation; Region-based image retrieval","Catalog services; Collaborative filtering; Collaborative filtering methods; Content based filtering; Distance functions; Feature clustering; Feature space; Feature-based; Image content; Mobile phone services; Multimedia contents; Purchase sequences; Rapid expansion; Rapid growth; Real image data; Recommendation algorithms; Region-based image retrieval; Service provider; Visual feature; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; Image retrieval; Multimedia services; Profitability; Signal filtering and prediction; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone systems; Image segmentation","Barnard, K., Duygulu, P., Guru, R., Gabbur, P., Forsyth, D., The effects of segmentation and feature choice in a translation model of object recognition (2003) Proc.

This paper proposes a simple and effective method to extract the text and perform intelligent IR from Tamil Document Images without Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This methodology generates a feature string for every word image by extracting its features. This relies on their basic characteristics or shapes of letters instead of recognising the letters like OCR. The strength of this technique lies in extracting the text based on their basic features such as lines and black and white disposition rates in characters which is almost same for the characters across various font sizes and font faces. As an offline process, document images are preprocessed and text extraction process extracts the features from the word images based on their shapes and they are stored in temporary files. During online retrieval, textual keyword is obtained from the user and its primitive string is framed. Based on the primitive string, IR is performed and the resultant images are provided to the user. This technique could be easily adopted in large digital libraries for IR.

The current situation of Korean public libraries is to be examined, centering upon the issue of storage space, and possible solutions are to be presented. Design/methodology/approach - A corroborative analysis is done to determine the seriousness of the problem and the plausibility of the assertion by looking only at the National Library of Korea and public libraries. Findings - By the end of 2005 Korean public libraries as a whole had reached 92 percent capacity, which suggests that there is an immediate need to secure additional storage space. Library collection size increased at a rate of 11.5 percent over a period of ten years (1996-2005). Even if a more moderate rate of 7 percent is applied to projections for 2015 storage space we will exceeded by 38.9 percent and the ratio of shortage in storage space to storage limit is expected to amount to 82.1 percent. Originality/value - This paper proposes the establishment of collaborative repositories, borrowing the principle of selection and concentration. The model for hub-based collaborative repositories is provided and the roles of the repository network are outlined. This will effectively increase the circulation turnover rate while reducing a user's opportunity costs. In the meantime, the National Library will be contributing to the country's decentralization and balanced national development and also increasing its own value. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Archives management; Collections management; National libraries; South Korea","Decentralized control; Digital libraries; Mathematical models; User interfaces; Archives management; Collaborative repositories; Collections management; Computer supported cooperative work","Library Of Korea, N., (2002) A Report on the Strategic Direction for Developing Korean National Digital Library, , National Library of Korea Seoul; Library Of Korea, N., (2005) National Library of Korea, 2010, , National Library of Korea Seoul; Yoon, H.-Y., (2002) Academic Library Management, , Taeil-sa Daegu; Henden, J., The Norwegian Repository Library (2005) Library Management, 26 (12), pp. 73-8; Kempf, K., Storage solutions in a co-operative library system: The case of Germany/Bavaria (2005) Library Management, 26 (12), pp. 79-88; Kenney, A.R., Surveying the e-journal preservation landscape (2006) ARL: A Bimonthly Report on Research Library Issues and Action from ARL, CNI, and SPARC, 245. , available at: www.arl.org/newsltr/245/ARLBR245preserv.pdf; Of Culture, M., Tourism, (2005) Public Library Statistics in Korea, , Korea Government Seoul; Library Of Korea, N., (2005) Library Cooperative Network Operation Research 2005, , National Library of Korea Seoul; Preservation Office, N., (2001) A National Preservation Strategy for Library and Archive Collections in the United Kingdom and Ireland: Principles and Prospects, , British Library London; Reilly, B.F., (2003) Developing Print Repositories: Models for Shared Preservation and Access, , Council on Library and Information Resources Washington, DC; Council For Museums, T., (2001) Archives and Libraries Building on Success: An Action Plan for Public Libraries, , Resource London; Varlamoff, M.-T., The share of preservation issues when planning a library building (2002) Liber Quarterly, 12 (1), pp. 14-25; Yoon, H.-Y., (2006) A Study on the Basic Planning for Branch Library of National Library of Korea, , National Library of Korea Seoul",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - Provides a description of an academic digital library's evolution into an institutional repository, accompanied by both practical and philosophical analyses. Findings - Materials supporting an academic institution's scholarship (from colleges and from supporting organizations on campus) can play an important part in the success of an institutional repository. Standards for metadata content, data structures and hierarchies of collections must be followed consistently, and adequate storage for digital media within an institutional repository is necessary to have in advance of anticipated demand for the smooth operation of the IR and continued access to materials. Gray areas between the role of an institutional repository and the role of that organization's archives need to be addressed in the future. Practical implications - Academic libraries can be highly successful in producing an institute repository by developing relationships with various organizations on campus in addition to the academic programs. Maintaining standards throughout the IR is crucial to future growth in an organized and consistent manner. Philosophical considerations of the role of the IR should be addressed in the beginning stages of the development of the IR for eliminating confusion and duplication of its contents with other campus organizations. Originality/value - This paper describes the development of a digital library, created and maintained by an academic library, and its gradual change into a de facto institutional repository. Other libraries in the planning stages or initial steps of creating a campus-wide digital library or an institutional repository can benefit from the description of possible successes and problems that they could encounter during implementation.","Archives management; Digital libraries",,"Buehler, M.A., Boateng, A., ""The evolving impact of institutional repositories on reference librarians"" (2005) Reference Services Review, 33 (3), p. 291; Cervone, H.F., ""The repository adventure"" (2004) Library Journal, 129 (10), pp. 44-46; Hayes, H., (2005) ""Digital Repositories, Helping Universities and Colleges"", , JISC briefing paper, August, Scotland; Pearce-Moses, R., (2005) A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology, , The Society of American Archivists Chicago, IL",Review,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - The concepts of e-Science are illustrated by a discussion of the CombeChem, eBank and SmartTea projects. The issue of open access is then discussed with reference to arXiv, PubMed Central and EPrints. The challenges these trends present to the library community are discussed in the context of the TARDis project and the University of Southampton Research Repository. Findings - Increasingly academics will need to collaborate in multidisciplinary teams distributed across several sites in order to address the next generation of scientific problems. In addition, new high-throughput devices, high-resolution surveys and sensor networks will result in an increase in scientific data collected by several orders of magnitude. To analyze, federate and mine this data will require collaboration between scientists and computer scientists; to organize, curate and preserve this data will require collaboration between scientists and librarians. A vital part of the developing research infrastructure will be digital repositories containing both publications and data. Originality/value - The paper provides a synthesis of e-Science concepts, the question of open access to the results of scientific research, and a changing attitude towards academic publishing and communication.

The project kopal tackles this problem head-on: in a three-year project kopal's objective is the practical testing and implementation of a cooperatively created and operated long-term archival system for digital resources. Design/methodology/approach - The system will be implementedin accordance with international standards for long-term archiving and metadata within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) framework. The project partners, Die Deutsche Bibliothek (DDB), Göttingen State and University Library (SUB Göttingen), IBM Deutschland GmbH and the Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG), will establish a cooperatively transferable solution for cultural heritage institutions, as well as for business and industry. Findings - Within the project, the project partners DDB and SUB Göttingen are developing software for the input and access of data, which will be released under an open-source license. Research limitations/implications - Long-term preservation methods and strategies will be discussed in general in the paper. Practical implications - The project will present a stable and reusable platform for additional partners and users, especially for cultural heritage organisations. Originality/value - The solution is based on Digital Information and Archiving System (DIAS), jointly devised by IBM and the National Library of The Netherlands in The Hague, and it will be adapted to the needs of the project with several extensions. Establishing a collaborative solution for long-term preservation is a milestone in the development of systems for the long-term availability of digital objects.","Archives management; Digital libraries; Digital storage; Germany",,"Neubauer, M., Wollschläger, T., ""Maschinelle Gewinnung technischer Metadaten für die Langzeitarchivierung elektronischer Publikationen"" (2006) B.I.T.

This is especially true for applications in the parallel computing domain that frequently perform large amounts of file I/O. Collective I/O strategy that coordinates the processes to perform I/O on each other's behalf has demonstrated a significant performance improvement. This article proposes a new concept called Multicollective I/O (MCIO) that expands the collective I/O to allow data from multiple files to be requested in a single I/O request, in contrast to allowing only multiple segments for a single file to be specified together. MCIO considers multiple arrays simultaneously by having a more global view of the overall I/O behavior exhibited by parallel applications. This article shows that determining the optimal MCIO access pattern is an NP-complete problem, and proposes two different heuristics for the access pattern detection problem, also called the assignment problem. Both heuristics have been implemented within a runtime library, and tested using a large-scale scientific application. Our results show that MCIO outperforms collective I/O by as much as 87%. Our runtime library-based implementation can be used by application users as well as by optimizing compilers. Based on our results, we recommend that future library designers for I/O-intensive applications include MCIO in their suite of optimizations. © 2006 ACM.","Collective I/O; File accesses; Parallel I/O; Runtime library; Software optimizations","Collective I/O; File accesses; Parallel I/O; Runtime library; Software optimizations; Computational methods; Digital libraries; Heuristic methods; Input output programs; Optimization; Problem solving; Data storage equipment","Bagrodia, R., Chien, A., Hsu, Y., Reed, D., Input/output: Instrumentation, characterization, modeling and management policy (1994) Proceedings of the Scalable I/O Initiative, , Caltech Concurrent Supercomputing Facilities; Baru, S., (1997) Storage Resource Broker (SRB) Reference Manual, , Enabling Technologies, San Diego Supercomputer Center.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the reasons why the productivity of women in library and information should be enhanced; to describe problems which militate against this; and to highlight their future prospects. Design/methodology/approach - These objectives are achieved through the descriptive survey methodology. Findings - The finding is that, in spite of the fact that the productivity of women in Nigeria has generally been regarded as low because of traditional prejudices against women and lack of data on the productivity of women in the informal sector, the productivity of women in the library and information sector has remained high and needs enhancement to encourage them to aim higher in the profession. One way of achieving this is by getting them fully involved in information technology. Another way is government's financial support of their aspirations towards training and retraining; attendance to seminar-workshops, exchange programmes in connection with sabbatical leave appointments, etc. Research limitations/implications - For further research, this paper suggests an investigation into the implications of government's investment on women librarians for the harnessing of knowledge and information for sustainable rural development in Nigeria. Practical implications - The practical implication of the paper is that with government's focus on women librarians to tap their potentials, they will become more sensitive in their professional practice and will endeavour to show-case their enhanced productivity. Originality/value - The new value is the suggestion that women librarians should be incorporated to assist in producing national data on the productivity of women in the informal sector. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Information personnel; Information profession; Nigeria; Productivity rate; Women","Developing countries; Information services; Information technology; Personnel; Productivity; Information personnel; Information profession; Nigeria; Productivity rate; Women; Digital libraries","Adomi, E.E., Okiy, R.B., Ruteyan, J.O., ""A survey of cybercafés in Delta State, Nigeria"" (2003) The Electronic Library, 22 (5), pp. 487-495; Ahiante, A., ""Networking Africa for change"" (2002) This Day, p. 50. , 19 March, (Report from a training programme organised by Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in collaboration with other UN agencies at the ECA headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), also available at: www.dehai.org/archives/dehai_news_archive/mar02/0265.html; Aina, J.O., ""Leadership skills of women librarians in West Africa"" (1995) Journal of Educational Media and Library Science, 33 (2), pp. 172-177; Anderson, K., ""Globalization, the World Trade Organization, and development strategies of poorer countries"" (2002) 21st Century Catalysts for Development: Local Dynamics in an Era of Globalization, pp. 1-8. , Yusuf, S., Evenett, S. and Wu, W.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on the management of records in Nigerian universities. Findings - The study reveals that records management programmes or policy on records are not available in Nigerian universities; hence the administration of records is without recourse to the principles of records management. There is no University Records Manual, no records retention and disposition schedule, personnel handling the records are not trained in records management, inadequate facilities for the preservation, storage, and retrieval of records, no filing manual, inadequate computers to manage the volume of records generated and the attitude of administrators towards records and records management constitute the problems of records management in Nigerian universities. Originality/value - The article notes a number of recommendations made to improving records management practices in Nigerian universities. The university management and administrators and personnel handling the records should develop a positive attitude towards records and implement records management programmes in Nigerian universities. Records have ""life"", and should be allowed to live through their life cycle process.

While there are many definitions of genre, most include consideration of the intended communicative purpose, form and sometimes expected content of a document. Most also include the notion of social acceptance, that a document is of a particular genre to the extent that it is recognized as such within a given discourse community. Design/methodology/approach - The article reviews the notion of document genre and its applicability to studies of digital documents and introduces the four articles in the special issue. Findings - Genre can be studied based on intrinsic genre attributes or on the extrinsic function that genre fulfills in human activities. Studies on intrinsic attributes include classifications of genres as clusters of attributes, though these classifications can be problematic because documents can be used in flexible ways. Also, new information technologies have enabled the appearance of novel genres. Studies on extrinsic function include ways to use genre for education or information accesses, as well as the use of genre as a lens for understanding communications in organizations. The four articles in the special issue illustrate these approaches.

The PHR also includes a messaging system that can be structured into the workflow of referral management as well as allowing more general communications. A preliminary study was conducted with 61 patients. Thirty-two patients completed a survey in which 85% of respondents were satisfied with the usability and 94% were satisfied with the overall online referral process. The consulting physicians were satisfied with the content of subjects' personal health information and referral problem descriptions and found the information detailed enough to triage all requested referrals. Patients, physicians, and patient care coordinators reported that their communications were enhanced by the system and found the messaging component convenient to use. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Health; Health care; Information management; Information use; Medical problems; Patient treatment; Records management; World Wide Web; Medical record; Patient centered care; Personal health information management systems; Referral management; Web based personal health record; Digital libraries; adult; aged; article; clinical trial; comparative study; computer interface; consumer; data base; decision support system; human; information retrieval; information system; Internet; male; medical record; methodology; middle aged; patient referral; self care; United States; validation study; Adult; Aged; Consumer Satisfaction; Database Management Systems; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Information Management; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Male; Medical Records; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Middle Aged; Referral and Consultation; Self Care; United States; User-Computer Interface","(2001) Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century, , Nat.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML Signature and XML Encryption [3] standards provide mechanisms for harnessing the strengths of XML in applications with cryptographic requirements. The standards provide two complementary capabilities. Firstly, they provide a mechanism for dealing with some of the inherent problems in performing cryptographic operations on a markup language. Cryptographic algorithms generally deal with data on a byte-by-byte basis. In a XML document, much of the markup structure can be modified in ways that do not change the actual meaning of the data being represented. The XML Signature standard provides a means of ensuring changes that do not impact the meaning of a document also do not change the validity of a signature. Secondly, the standards provide powerful and flexible signature and encryption mechanisms that build on the native abilities of XML. Applications can use these standards to (amongst other things): represent signatures and encrypted data in a XML format; sign and encrypt arbitrary portions of XML documents; and sign multiple documents or sections of documents with a single signature, in a manner that allows a change in one document to not break the signature for the other documents. This article provides an overview of how the XML Signature and XML Encryption standards provide these mechanisms. It discusses some of the problems inherent in signing and encrypting XML documents, and then examines some samples of XML Signature and XML Encryption. The various components of the standards are described as they appear in the sample XML fragments.

However the efficiency of FC-SAN virtual storage strongly depends on some attributes of the stored documents. In some cases, FC-SAN may even perform no better than the sharing data on LAN. This paper illustrates this point by a study on the data placement and access path selection issues in a network storage environment. The paper first presents a linear time-consuming model of data access through the analysis of the virtual storage principle and then gives a decision-making method for data placement and access path selection problem. In the development of this method, the concept of equivalent of virtual storage cost is defined to evaluate the data placement cost in the FC-SAN virtual storage environment. Finally, the theoretical analysis, methods, and assumptions are proved by the experimental results based on a massive storage subsystem in a digital library prototype.","Access path selection; Data placement; FC-SAN; Networked storage; Virtual storage","Data processing; Data storage equipment; Local area networks; Mathematical models; Virtual reality; Virtual storage; Access path selection; Cost models; Data placement; Directly attached storage; Fiber channels; Networked storage; Storage area networks; Digital libraries","Clark, T., Design storage area network: A practical reference for implementing fibre channel SANs (2000), pp. 1-6. , 2nd ed., Massachusetts: Addison Wesley Longman, IncPhillips, B., Have storage area networks come of age (1998) IEEE Computer, 31 (7), pp. 10-12; http://www.snia.org/, Storage Networking Industry AssociationKilmatin, P., Success stories in high availability using VERITAS software eBay (2001), http://eval.veritas.com/downloads/sus/eBay.pdfOld ominion University moves up to a smart SAN solution from IBM and Vicom (1999), http://www.storage.ibm.com/ibmsan/press/dominion/dominion.pdf, IBMCP and L automates remote data backups with an integrated IBM storage solution (2000), http://www.storage.ibm.com/ibmsan/magstar.pdf, IBMFrequently Asked Questions Tivoli® SANergyTM (2001), http://www.tivoli.com/products/documents/faqs/sanergy_faq.html, IBM Tivoli(2000) Tivoli SANergy Administrator's Guide Version 2 Release 2, , IBM Tivoli, 2nd ed; Xing, C.X., Zhou, L.Z., Developing Tsinghua University architecture digital library for Chinese architecture study and university education (2002) Proc. of the 5th Int'l Conf. on Asian Digital Libraries, pp. 206-217. , Lim E.P.

The factors that deteriorate the concurrency of index structures are node splits and minimum bounding region (MBR) updates in multidimensional index structures. The properties of our concurrency control algorithm are as follows: First, to increase the concurrency by avoiding lock coupling during MBR updates, we propose the PLC (Partial Lock Coupling) technique. Second, a new MBR update method is proposed. It allows searchers to access nodes where MBR updates are being performed. Finally, our algorithm holds exclusive latches not during whole split time but only during physical node split time that occupies the small part of a whole split process. For performance evaluation, we implement the proposed concurrency control algorithm and one of the existing link technique-based algorithms on MIDAS-MI that is a storage system of a BADA-IV DBMS. We show through various experiments that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm in terms of throughput and response time. Also, we propose a recovery protocol for our proposed concurrency control algorithm. The recovery protocol is designed to assure high concurrency and fast recovery.","Concurrency control; Multidimensional index structure; Performance evaluation","Algorithms; Concurrency control; Content based retrieval; Database systems; Digital libraries; Geographic information systems; Information retrieval systems; Optimization; Performance; Problem solving; Minimum boundary regions (MBR); Multidimensional index structure; Performance evaluation; Data structures","Guttman, A., R-Trees: A Dynamic Index Structure for Spatial Searching (1984) Proc.

Consequently, cheaper and denser tertiary storage systems are being integrated into the storage hierarchies of these applications. Although tertiary storage is cheaper, the access latency is very high due to the need to load and unload media on the drives. This high latency and the bursty nature of I/O traffic result in the accumulation of I/O requests for tertiary storage. We study the problem of scheduling these requests to improve performance. In particular we address the issues of scheduling across multiple tapes or disks as opposed to most other studies which consider only one or two media. We focus on algorithms that minimize the number of switches and show through simulation that these result in near-optimal schedules. For single drive libraries an efficient algorithm that produces optimal schedules is developed. For multiple drives the problem is shown to be NP-Complete. Efficient and effective heuristics are presented for both single and multiple drives. The scheduling policies developed achieve significant performance gains over naive policies. The algorithms are simple to implement and are not restrictive. The study encompasses all types of storage libraries handling removable media, such as tapes and optical disks.","I/O scheduling; Multiple drives; Optimal; Removable media; Single-drive; Tape libraries","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Heuristic methods; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic tape storage; Multimedia systems; Optical disk storage; Storage allocation (computer); Multiple drives; Removable media; Tape libraries; Tertiary storage; Digital libraries","Andrews, M., Bender, M.A., Zhang, L., New algorithms for the disk scheduling problem (1996) Foundations of Computer Science; Carey, M.J., Haas, L.M., Livny, M., Tapes hold data, too: Challenges of tuples on tertiary store Proc.

Among the reasons for this discrepancy are hardware/software mismatches, modularization overheads introduced by software engineering considerations, and the inability of systems to adapt to users' behaviors. A solution to these problems is to delay code generation until load time. This is the earliest point at which a piece of software can be fine-tuned to the actual capabilities of the hardware on which it is about to be executed, and also the earliest point at wich modularization overheads can be overcome by global optimization. A still better match between software and hardware can be achieved by replacing the already executing software at regular intervals by new versions constructed on-the-fly using a background code re-optimizer. This not only enables the use of live profiling data to guide optimization decisions, but also facilitates adaptation to changing usage patterns and the late addition of dynamic link libraries. This paper presents a system that provides code generation at load-time and continuous program optimization at run-time. First, the architecture of the system is presented. Then, two optimization techniques are discussed that were developed specifically in the context of continuous optimization. The first of these optimizations continually adjusts the storage layouts of dynamic data structures to maximize data cache locality, while the second performs profile-driven instruction re-scheduling to increase instruction-level parallelism. These two optimizations have very different cost/benefit ratios, presented in a series of benchmarks. The paper concludes with an outlook to future research directions and an enumeration of some remaining research problems. The empirical results presented in this paper make a case in favor of continuous optimization, but indicate that it needs to be applied judiciously. In many situations, the costs of dynamic optimizations outweigh their benefit, so that no break-even point is ever reached. In favorable circumstances, on the other hand, speed-ups of over 120% have been observed. It appears as if the main beneficiaries of continuous optimization are shared libraries, which at different times can be optimized in the context of the currently dominant client application. © 2003 ACM.","Continuous program optimization; Dynamic code generation; Dynamic reoptimization","Continuous program optimization; Dynamic code generation; Dynamic reoptimization; Research problems; Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Data storage equipment; Data structures; Decision theory; Digital libraries; Optimization; Problem solving; Software engineering; Program compilers","Adl-Tabatabai, A.-R., Cierniak, M., Lueh, C.-Y., Parikh, V.M., Stichnoth, J.M., Fast, effective code generation in a just-in-time Java compiler (1998) Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN '98 Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), pp. 280-290. , Montreal, Canada; Alpern, B., Attanasio, C.R., Barton, J.J., Cocchi, A., Hummel, S.F., Lieber, D., Ngo, T., Smith, S., Implementing Jalapeno in Java (1999) Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN '99 Conference on Object-oriented Programming Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA); Alpern, B., Cocchi, A., Lieber, D., Mergen, M., Sarkar, V., Jalapeño - A compiler-supported Java virtual machine for servers (1999) Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN 1999 Workshop on Compiler Support for System Software (WCSSS'99), , Atlanta, Gorgia; Anderson, J.M., Berc, L., Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., Henzinger, M., Leung, S.-T.A., Sites, D., Weihl, W.E., Continuous profiling: Where have all the cycles gone?

Numerous incidents of buffer overflow attacks have been reported and many solutions have been proposed, but a solution that is both complete and highly practical is yet to be found. Another kind of vulnerability called format string overflow has recently been found and although not as widespread as buffer overflow, format string overflow attacks are no less dangerous. This article surveys representative techniques of exploiting buffer overflow and format string overflow vulnerabilities and their currently available defensive measures. We also describe our buffer overflow detection technique that range checks the referenced buffers at run-time. We augment executable files with the type information of automatic buffers (local variables and parameters of functions) and static buffers (global variables in the data/bss section) and maintain the sizes of allocated heap buffers in order to detect an actual occurrence of buffer overflow. We describe a simple implementation with which we currently protect vulnerable copy functions in the C library.","Array and pointer range checking; Buffer overflow; ELF; Format string overflow; Linux","C (programming language); Digital libraries; Information technology; Security of data; Buffer overflow; Format string overflow; Pointer range checking; Buffer storage","http://www.cert.org, CERT Coordination Centerhttp://www.securityfocus.com/archive, Bugtraq Mailing ListWagner, D., Foster, J.S., Brewer, E.A., Aiken, A., A first step towards automated detection of buffer overrun vulnerabilities Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, San Diego, CA, February 2000, pp. 3-17; Cowan, C., Wagle, P., Pu, C., Beattie, S., Walpole, J., Buffer overflows: Attacks and defenses for the vulnerability of the decade Proceedings DARPA Information Survivability Conference and Exposition, Hilton Head, SC, January 2000, pp. 119-129; Smashing the stack for fun and profit (1996) Phrack, 7 (49). , Aleph One; How to write buffer overflows (1995), http://10pht.com/advisories/bufero.html, MudgeThe frame pointer overwrite (1999) Phrack, 9 (55). , Klog; Taking advantage of non-terminated adjacent memory spaces (2000) Phrack, 10 (56). , Twitch; Getting around non-executable stack (and fix) (1997) Bugtraq Mailing List, , http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/7480, Solar Designer; [August]; Wojtczuk, R., Defeating solar designer non-executable stack patch Bugtraq Mailing List, , http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/8470; The advanced return-into-lib(c) exploits: PaX case study (2001) Phrack, 10 (58). , Nergal; https://pageexec.virtualave.net, PaXNon-executable stack patch http://www.openwall.com/linux, Solar Designerhttp://cliph.linux.pl/kNoX, kNoXExecutable and Linkable Format Version 1.1, , ftp://download.intel.com/design/perftool/tis/elfllg.zip, TIS; Conover, M., (1999) W00w00 on Heap Overflows, , http://www.w00w00.org/files/articles/heaptut.txt, [January]; Rivas, J., Overwriting the .dtors section http://www.synnergy.net/downloads/papers/dtors.txtStallman, R.M., (1999) Using and Porting GNU CC (Version 2.95), , Free Software Foundation: Boston, MA; Bouchareine, P., Atexit in memory bugs-specific proof of concept with statically linked binaries and heap overflows http://community.corest.com/~juliano/heap_atexit.txtSmashing C++ VPTRs (2000) Phrack, 10 (56). , Rix; Kaempf, M., Vudo-an object superstitiously believed to embody magical powers (2001), http://www.synnergy.net/downloads/papers/vudo-howto.txtExploiting format string vulnerabilities (2001), http://www.team-teso.net/releases/formatstring-1.2.tar.gz, Scut, team teso; [September]Once upon a free() (2001) Phrack, 10 (57); Bypassing stackguard and stackshield (2000) Phrack, 10 (56). , Bulba, Kil3r; Cowan, C., Pu, C., Maier, D., Hinton, H., Walpole, J., Bakke, P., Beattie, S., Zhang, Q., StackGuard: Automatic adaptive detection and prevention of buffer-overflow attacks Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Security Symposium.

To reduce the demands on I/O and network resources, multi-resolution representations are being proposed for the storage organization of images. Image decomposition techniques such as wavelets can be used to provide these multi-resolution images. The original image is represented by several coefficients, one of them with visual similarity to the original image, but at a lower resolution. These visually similar coefficients can be thought of as thumbnails or icons of the original image. This paper addresses the problem of storing these multi-resolution coefficients on disks so that thumbnail browsing as well as image reconstruction can be performed efficiently. Several strategies are evaluated to store the image coefficients on parallel disks. These strategies can be classified into two broad classes, depending on whether the access pattern of the images is used in the placement. Disk simulation is used to evaluate the performance of these strategies. Simulation results are validated with results from experiments with real Disks, and are found to be in good qualitative agreement. The results indicate that significant performance improvements can be achieved with as few as four disks by placing image coefficients based upon browsing access patterns.","Browsing; Declustering; Multiresolution image storage; Parallel I/O; Wavelets","Computer simulation; Digital libraries; Image reconstruction; Image retrieval; Browsing; Multiresolution image storage; Digital image storage","Alexandrov, A.D., Ma, W.Y., El Abbadi, A., Manjunath, B.S., Adaptive filtering and indexing for image databases (1995) Proceedings SPIE Int.

Since the access of a tope library is often random and the tape library has low random access performance, thus it is critical to study the random I/O scheduling strategies and algorithms in order to improve the performance of the tape library. We study a cost-benefit-based scheduling algorithm, and as well as give an effective estimating method of cost-benefit weight ratio. This algorithm improves the performance of tape library system under different workloads by dynamically tuning the cost-benefit weight ratio of scheduling policies according to workloads. This algorithm particularly overcomes the problem of workload-sensitive of existing scheduling algorithms, and is significantly effective under heavy workload.","Cost-benefit estimating; Hot data replication; Online tape library system; Random I/O scheduling","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Data processing; Digital libraries; Estimation; Magnetic tape storage; Online systems; Scheduling; Cost benefit estimation; Cost benefit weight ratio; Data replication; Online the libraries; Random I/O scheduling; Database systems","Carino, F., Kaufmann, A., Kostamaa, P., Are you ready for Yottabytes (2000) Proceedings of the 17th IEEE Symposium on Mass Storage Systems in Cooperation with the 8th NASA GSFC Conference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies, pp. 476-485. , Kobler B.

The problem of minimizing the cost of accessing data stored in all media is critical to the performance of the system. Given the large storage requirements of modern applications, tertiary storage subsystems have become a crucial component of modern large-scale storage servers. This paper's contribution refers to the performance improvement of tertiary storage systems by the use of specific scheduling algorithms implemented under Java programming environment. The paper presents a general model to be applied to different tertiary storage topologies under various computer platforms. Magnetic tapes and tape libraries models are examined by the Java-based simulation model in order to increase functionality and interactivity. The Java-based model is validated and experimented by three most widely used scheduling algorithms, SORT, SLF, and SCAN policies. Comparative analysis of the scheduling policies and discussion of the most beneficial scheduling policy for each model are provided.","I/O scheduling; Java-based models and applications; Storage systems performance; Tertiary storage management","Algorithms; Digital libraries; Input output programs; Java programming language; Magnetic tape; Mathematical models; Servers; Topology; Scheduling algorithms; Tertiary storage subsystems; Data storage equipment","Prabhakar, S., Agrawal, D., El Abbabi, A., Singh, A., (1996) Tertiarty storage: Current status and future trends, , TR-CS96-21, University of California at Santa Barbara; Chervenak, A.L., (1994) Tertiary storage: An evaluation of new applications, , doctoral diss., University of California at Berkeley, CA; Cohen, E.I., King, G.M., Brady, J.T., Storage hierarchies (1989) IBM Systems Journal, 28 (1), pp. 62-76; Hillyer, B.K., Silberschatz, A., On the modeling and performance characteristics of serpentine tape (1996) Proc.

Conventional data archives are designed so that data is ingested into the system, and retrieved by users to satisfy particular requests. An active data archive can be defined as one where much of the data is generated on-demand, as value-added data products or services derived from existing data holdings. Interfacing users and applications to such an archive system requires a more complex infrastructure than conventional or passive archive systems. We describe two archive systems we have built for providing web-based access to satellite and geospatial imagery as well as to medical imagery such as that from the Visible Human datasets. We contrast the requirements and features of these archives and discuss the Java and CORBA software infrastructure that we have developed to interface to them. We also describe our integration of commercial products, such as StudioCentral and Informix with our software and some of the geospatial standard interface definitions, such as GIAS and OpenGIS.",,"Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Data structures; Distributed database systems; Information retrieval; Java programming language; Online systems; Common object request broker architecture (CORBA); Digital libraries; Digital storage","Coddington, P.D., Hawick, K.A., James, H.A., Web-based access to distributed high-performance geographic information systems for decision support (1999) Proc.

This article presents a framework for (and experimentally analyzes a solution to) this problem, which we call the text-source discovery problem. Our approach consists of two phases. First, each text source exports its contents to a centralized service. Second, users present queries to the service, which returns an ordered list of promising text sources. This article describes GlOSS, Glossary of Servers Server, with two versions: bGlOSS, which provides a Boolean query retrieval model, and vGlOSS, which provides a vector-space retrieval model. We also present hGlOSS, which provides a decentralized version of the system. We extensively describe the methodology for measuring the retrieval effectiveness of these systems and provide experimental evidence, based on actual data, that all three systems are highly effective in determining promising text sources for a given query.","Digital libraries; Distributed information retrieval; H.3 [Information Systems]; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet search and retrieval; Measurement; Performance; Text databases",,"Barbará, D., Clifton, C., Information brokers: Sharing knowledge in a heterogeneous distributed system (1992) Tech.

The proposed shape comparison method operates on edge maps and derives holistic similarity measures, yet, it does not require solving the point correspondence problem. While the use of edge images is important to introduce robustness to changes in illumination, the lack of point-to-point matching delivers speed and tolerance to local non-rigid distortions. In particular, we propose a face similarity measure derived as a variant of the Hausdorff distance by introducing the notion of a neighborhood function (N) and associated penalties (P). Experimental results on a large set of face images demonstrate that our approach produces excellent recognition results even when less than 3% of the original grey-scale face image information is stored in the face database (gallery). These results implicate that the process of face recognition may start at a much earlier stage of visual processing than it was earlier suggested. We argue, that edge-like retinal images of faces are initially screened ""at a glance"" without the involvement of high-level cognitive functions thus delivering high speed and reducing computational complexity. © 1998 Pattern Recognition Society.

These data are, however, very expensive to acquire and maintain. Moreover, their use is often restricted due to a lack of dissemination mechanisms. Digital libraries are a good approach for increasing data availability and therefore reducing costs, since they provide efficient storage and access to large volumes of data. One major drawback to this approach is that it creates the necessity of providing facilities for a large and heteerogeneous community of users to search and interact with these geographic libraries. We present a solution to this problem, based on a framework that allows the design and construction of customizable user interfaces for applications based on Geographic Digital Libraries (GDL). This framework relies on two main concepts: a geographic user interface architecture and a geographic digital library model. © Springer-Verlag 1999.","Digital libraries; Geographic data; Hypermedia models; User interfaces",,"Abiteboul, S., Bonner, A., Object and views (1991) In: Proc. of the 1991 ACM SIGMOD Int.
