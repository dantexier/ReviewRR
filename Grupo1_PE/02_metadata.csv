In particular, an overview of the frameworks developed to characterize such a multi-faceted concept is presented. Moreover, the most common quality-related problems affecting metadata both during the creation and the aggregation phase are discussed together with the approaches, technologies and tools developed to mitigate them. This survey on digital library developments is expected to contribute to the ongoing discussion on data and metadata quality occurring in the emerging yet more general framework of data infrastructures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes an infrastructure, called PhotoGeo, which aims at helping users with the people photo annotation, event photo annotation, storage and retrieval of personal digital photos. To achieve the desired objective, PhotoGeo uses new algorithms that make it possible to annotate photos with the key metadata to facilitate their retrieval, such as: the people who were shown in the photo (who); where it was captured (where); the date and time of capture (when); and the event that was captured.

However, numerous studies conducted over decades have shown that users routinely experience problems with subject access in library catalogs and databases. These problems are often due to inadequate quality of subject metadata, which is greatly influenced by complexity of subject representation. The fact that major cataloging standards (e.g., AACR2 and its predecessors) have been overlooking the importance of subject access and have not addressed subject cataloging is arguably one of the reasons behind problems in organization of subject access. The new cataloging code-Resource Description and Access (RDA)-attempts to fill this gap. Upon examination of how subject access is addressed in RDA and its underlying conceptual models that specify functional requirements for bibliographic control-FRBR, FRAD, and FRSAD-this article presents results of a study that used FRBR model as an analytical framework in examination of user search queries in a large-scale digital library. The findings of this study provide empirical data to inform the development of RDA sections that cover subject access, particularly subject entities and relationships. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bibliographic control; conceptual models; digital libraries; entity-relationship models; FRAD; FRBR; FRSAD; RDA; subject access; transaction log analysis; user searching",,"Allen, B., Cognitive research in information science: Implications for design (1991) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 26, pp. 3-37; Bates, M., The Getty end-user online searching project in the humanities: Report no. 6-Overview and conclusions (1996) College & Research Libraries, 57, pp. 514-523; Bates, M., Indexing and access for digital libraries and the Internet: Human, database, and domain factors (1998) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49 (13), pp. 1185-1205; Bates, M., Subject access in online catalogs: A design model (1986) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 37 (6), pp. 357-376; Beghtol, C., Bibliographic classification theory and text linguistics: Aboutness analysis, intertextuality and the cognitive act of classifying documents (1986) Journal of Documentation, 42 (2), pp. 84-113; Beitzel, S., Jensen, E., Chowdhury, A., Frieder, O., Grossman, D., Temporal analysis of a very large topically categorized Web query log (2007) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58 (2), pp. 166-178; Borgman, C., Why are online catalogs still hard to use?

The need to transform the data from a flat schema to a full-fledged ontology arose during preliminary works in the Polish research project SYNAT. The Digital Libraries Federation site offers aggregated metadata of more than 600,000 publications that constitute the first portion of data introduced into the Integrated Knowledge System - one of the services developed in the SYNAT project. To be able to perform the desired functions, IKS needs heavily linked data that can be searched semantically. The issue is not only one of mapping one schema element to another, as the conceptualization of CIDOC is significantly different from that of the DLF schema. In the paper we identify a number of problems that are common to all such transformations and propose solutions. Finally, we present statistics concerning the mapping process and the resulting knowledge base. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.","CIDOC CRM; digital libraries; metadata; ontologies; RDF repositories; semantic web; thesauri",,"Atkins, A., Fox, E., France, R., Suleman, H., (2008) ETD-MS: An Interoperability Metadata Standard for Electronic Theses and Dissertations, 1.2 Edn, , http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etd-ms-v1.00-rev2.html; Bishop, B., Kiryakov, A., Ognyanoff, D., Peikov, I., Tashev, Z., Velkov, R., OWLIM: A family of scalable semantic repositories (2010) Semantic Web - Interoperability, Usability, , http://www.semantic-web-journal.net, Applicability; Clayphan, R., (2011) Europeana Semantic Elements Specification, Version 3.3.1, , https://version1.europeana.eu/c/document-library/get-file?uuid= a830cb84-9e71-41d6-9ca3-cc36415d16f8&groupId=10602, January 24; Crofts, N., Doerr, M., Gill, T., Stead, S., Stiff, M., (2005) Definition of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, 5.0.2 Edn, , http://www.cidoc-crm.org/docs/cidoc-crm-version-5.0.2.pdf, June; Daćko, D., Józefowska, J., Lawrynowicz, A., An ontology based semantic library catalogue (2007) Proceeding of the 3rd Language & Technology Conference, Poznań, pp. 109-113; Derwojedowa, M., Piasecki, M., Szpakowicz, S., Zawisławska, M., Polish WordNet on a Shoestring (2007) Proceedings of Biannual Conference of the Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology, pp. 169-178. , Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, April 11-13; Doerr, M., (2000) Mapping of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set to the CIDOC CRM, , http://www.cidoc-crm.org/docs/dc-to-crm-mapping.pdf, Technical Report, 274, ICS-FORTH, Heraklion, Crete (July); Dudczak, A., Heliński, M., Mazurek, C., Mielnicki, M., Werla, M., Extending the Shibboleth Identity Management Model with a Networked User Profile (2008) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 179-182. , Gdańsk, May 18-21; Fellbaum, C., Word net (1998) An Electronic Lexical Database, , MIT Press; Gill, T., Building semantic bridges between museums, libraries and archives: The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (2004) First Monday, 9 (5). , http://firstmonday.org; Görz, G., Oischinger, M., Schiemann, B., An implementation of the CIDOC conceptual reference model (4.2.4) in OWL-DL (2008) Proceedings of CIDOC 2008 - The Digital Curation of Cultural Heritage, , ICOM CIDOC, Athens; Hohmann, G., Scholz, M., Recommendation for the Representation of the Primitive Value Classes of the CRM As Data Types in RDF/OWL Implementations, , http://erlangen-crm.org/docs/crm-values-as-owl-datatypes.pdf; Kakali, K., Doerr, M., Papatheodorou, C., Stasinopoulou, T., (2007) Wp5 - Task 5.5 Dc.type Mapping to Cidoc/crm, , Technical report.

As a result, a number of network services have compiled databases from the public resources scattered over the Internet. However, publications by different conferences and journals adopt different citation styles. It is an interesting problem to accurately extract metadata from a citation string which is formatted in one of thousands of different styles. It has attracted a great deal of attention in research in recent years. In this paper, based on the notion of sequence alignment, we present a citation parser called BibPro that extracts components of a citation string. To demonstrate the efficacy of BibPro, we conducted experiments on three benchmark data sets. The results show that BibPro achieved over 90 percent accuracy on each benchmark. Even with citations and associated metadata retrieved from the web as training data, our experiments show that BibPro still achieves a reasonable performance.","Data integration; digital libraries; information extraction; sequence alignment","Academic publications; Benchmark data; Data integration; Growing demand; information extraction; Network services; Public resources; Sequence alignments; Training data; Digital libraries; Experiments; Metadata; Alignment","Lee, D., Kang, J., Mitra, P., Giles, C.L., On, B.-W., Are your citations clean?

Numerous institutions archives are going digitalized. People are able to access digital archives information, even if seldom people could access the original. However, on the current artificial intelligence methodology, it is still a hard problem to describe a story for humans after computer reading mass information. At this moment, if we can gather a lot of friends from the internet, discussing valuable photos, articles or videos from blogs, such as food and beverage blog, then, it would form a popular approach to set up a metadata. This paper offers this new concept to illustrate the new ideas, hoping that it can reduce the gap between current techniques and a willingness to create new ones.

But to be useful, metadata records must be problem free. When problems are present in the metadata, resources are not correctly represented and users are not able to reap the benefits of metadata. To minimize, if not eliminate, such problems, it is essential to understand the kinds of problems that can occur inmetadata records. In this paper, problems found inmetadata records as reported in the literature are compared and analyzed. It is found that five categories of metadata problems can be identified. These are the problems of Incorrect Values, Incorrect Elements, Missing Information, Information Loss, and Inconsistent Value Representation. Given that these problems are detrimental to the services that can be provided by metadata, preventive or corrective measures need to be put in place so as to ensure that the benefits derived from using metadata balance the costs and efforts spent in the creation of metadata records. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Digital library; Dublin Core; IEEE LOM; IMLS; Metadata problems",,"Baca, M., (2008) Introduction to metadata: Pathways to digital information (3.0), , http://www.getty.edu/research/conductingresearch/standards/intrometadata/metadata.html, [Online ed.].

This article examines the needs of users of taxonomic literature, specifically in relation to the transformation of traditional library material to digital form. It details the issues that arise in determining scanning priorities, avoiding duplication of scanning across the founding 12 natural history and botanical garden library collections, and the problems related to the complexity of serials, monographs, and series. Highlighted are the tools, procedures, and methodology for addressing the details of a mass-scanning operation. Specifically, keeping a steady flow of material, creation of page level metadata, and building services on top of data and metadata that meet the needs of the targeted communities.

Hence, digital libraries try to find solutions to interact with each other and other information centers to make accessible the valuable information. In fact, in case of interaction among libraries, there would be the possibility of accessing valuable information globally. This paper is an attempt to identify interoperability models and also the main compnents important for implementing interoperability projects. A survey of performed projects in this field reveals that this type of activities started from 1998, and the number of such projects increased since 2003 Also a preliminary study reveals that more than 50 percent of these projects originate from US. There are, in fact, three levels of interoperability: Technical, Content, and Organizational Interoperability. Considering the fact that this research emphasizes on technical level, the findin show that most digital libraries use OAI protocol, XML, and Dublin Core metadata standard.","Digital libraries; Interoperability; Interoperability models; Protocols",,"Mehdi, A.-H., Interoperability between library software: A solution for Iranian libraries (2008) The Electronic library, 28 (5), pp. 726-734; Arlitsch, K., Jonsson, J., Aggregating distributed digital collections in the Mountain West Digital Library with the CONTENTdm™ multi-site server (2005) Library Hi Tech, 23 (2), pp. 220-232. , DOI 10.1108/07378830510605179; Arms William, Y., Hilmann, D., Lagoze, C., Krafft, D., Marisa, R., Saylor, J., Terrizzi, C., Van De Sompel, H., A spectrum of interoperability (2002) D-Lib Magazine, 8, p. 1. , www.dlib.org/dlib/january02/arms/01arms.html, accessed April 10, 2008; Brenda, B.H., Urban R, ., The Colorado digitization program: A collaboration success story (2004) Library Hi Tech, 22 (3), pp. 254-262; David, B., Ke, K.-Y., Witten, I.H., (2006) Document Level Interoperability for Collection Creators in Jcdl '06 Proceedings of The 6th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 105-106. , New York: ACM; Bell, J., Lewis, S., Using OAI-PMH and METS for exporting metadata and digital objects between repositories (2006) Program, 40 (3), pp. 268-276. , DOI 10.1108/00330330610681349; Mic, B.C., Peter, B., Manber, D.U., Schwartz, M.F., (1994) Scalable Internet Resource Discovery: Research Problems and Approaches, 37 (8), pp. 98-107. , Communications of the ACM; (2001) Digital Libraries: Future Directions for a European Research Program, , http://delosnoe.iei.pi.cnr.it/activities/researchforum/Brainstorming/ brainstorming-report.pdf, DELOS, DELOS, San Cassiano (Dolomites), accessed April 10, 2008); Ding, H., Solvberg, I., Rule-based metadata interoperation in heterogeneous digital libraries (2007) Electronic Library, 25 (2), pp. 193-206. , DOI 10.1108/02640470710741322, Metadata and Semantics for Digital Libraries; Fox Edward, A., Marchionini G, ., Toward a worldwide digital library (1998) Communications of the ACM, 41 (4), pp. 29-32; Niah, G., Ipeirotis, P.G., Gravano L, ., (2001) Sdlip + Starts = Sdarts A Protocol and Toolkit for Metasearching in JCDL'01 Proceedings of The 1st ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 207-214. , New York: ACM; Yan H, ., A RDF-based digital library system (2006) Library Hi Tech, 24 (2), pp. 234-240; Jayakanth, F., Maly, K., Zubair, M., Aswath, L., A dynamic approach to make CDS/ISIS databases interoperable over the internet using the OAI protocol (2006) Program, 40 (3), pp. 277-285. , DOI 10.1108/00330330610681358; Yi J, ., The development of the China networked digital library of thesis and dissertations (2004) Online Information Review, 28 (5), pp. 367-370; Joanne, K., Chiat N.C, ., A statewide metasearch service using OAI-PMH and Z39.50 (2005) Library Hi Tech, 23 (4), pp. 576-586; Carl, L., Van De Sompel, H., (2001) The Open Archives Initiative: Building a Low Cost Interoperability Framework in JCDL'01 Proceedings of The 1st ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 54-62. , New York: ACM; Carl, L., Krafft, D., Cornwell, T., Dushay, N., Eckstrom, D., Saylor, J., (2006) Metadata Aggregation and ""automated Digital Libraries"": A Retrospective on the NSDL Experience in JCDL '06 Proceedings of The 6th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 230-239. , New York: ACM; Zakaria, M., (1998) Contribution a La Resolution Des Problems D' interoperabilite Des Systems: Une Method de Conception Par Frameworks Orientes-Agents Logiciels, , PhD diss., Universite Laval; Mark, N., Z39.50 - A review, analysis and some thoughts on the future (2000) Library Hi Tech, 18 (2), pp. 158-165; Nelson Michael, L., Rocker, J., Harrison, T.L., (2003) OAI and NASA's Scientific and Technical Information.

However, these resources have a wide variety of formats, terminologies, and concepts, which makes it difficult to find appropriate information for materials design, development, and evaluation. One solution to this problem is to integrate these resources into a computer readable concept map, called a domain ontology, which describes concepts and relationships among the concepts in materials science and engineering. This paper describes a trial that constructs a standard of metadata description using ontology language and demonstrates the validity of this construction through data exchange among heterogeneous material databases. ""Materials Ontology,"" which consists of several sub ontologies corresponding to substance, process, environment, and property, is developed using the ontology language of the Semantic Web, OWL, which enables the definition of a flexible and detailed structure of materials information. A versatile ""materials data format"" is built on the Materials Ontology as a component of the materials information platform and is applied to exchange data among three different thermal property databases, maintained by two major materials science research institutes in Japan.","Information Integration; Material Database; Materials Properties; Ontology","Computational simulation; Concept maps; Data exchange; Data format; Domain ontologies; Heterogeneous materials; Information integration; Information platform; Information resource; Material Database; Materials design; Materials science and engineering; Ontology language; Raw measurements; Science research; Sub-ontology; Thermal properties; Digital libraries; Handbooks; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Materials science; Metadata; Ontology; Semantic Web; Thermodynamic properties; Materials properties","Ashino, T., Fujita, M., Definition of web ontology for design-oriented material selection (2006) Data Science Journal, 5, pp. 52-63; Ashino, T., Oka, N., Development of information platform for data exchange between heterogeneous material data resources (2007) Proceedings of PV 2007 Conference, Ensuring the Long-term Preservation and Value Adding to Scientific and Technical Data, , Munich; Bechhofer, S., Van Harmelen, F., Hendler, J., Horrocks, I., McGuiness, D.L., Patel-Schneider, P.F., Stein, L.A., (2004), http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref, OWL Web Ontology Language Reference, W3C Recommendation 10 February 2004.

Abandoning quality control altogether is problematic, because low-quality metadata compromise the effectiveness of services that repositories provide to their users. To address this problem, we present a set of scalable quality metrics for metadata based on the Bruce & Hillman framework for metadata quality control. We perform three experiments to evaluate our metrics: (1) the degree of correlation between the metrics and manual quality reviews, (2) the discriminatory power between metadata sets and (3) the usefulness of the metrics as low-quality filters. Through statistical analysis, we found that several metrics, especially Text Information Content, correlate well with human evaluation and that the average of all the metrics are roughly as effective as people to flag low-quality instances. The implications of this finding are discussed. Finally, we propose possible applications of the metrics to improve tools for the administration of digital repositories. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Digital libraries; Learning object repositories; Metadata quality; Metrics; Text information content",,"Barton, J., Currier, S., Hey, J.M.N., Building quality assurance into metadata creation: An analysis based on the learning objects and e-prints communities of practice (2003) Proceedings 2003 Dublin Core Conference: Supporting Communities of Discourse and Practice-Metadata Research and Applications, pp. 39-48. , S.

"Mehler A., Waltinger U.","Enhancing document modeling by means of open topic models: Crossing the frontier of classification schemes in digital libraries by example of the DDC",2009,"Library Hi Tech",27,4,,520,539,,3,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72049116355&partnerID=40&md5=5128774ace887262199e504fe24da414","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a topic classification model using the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) as the target scheme. This is to be done by exploring metadata as provided by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) to derive document snippets as minimal document representations. The reason is to reduce the effort of document processing in digital libraries. Further, the paper seeks to perform feature selection and extension by means of social ontologies and related web-based lexical resources. This is done to provide reliable topic-related classifications while circumventing the problem of data sparseness. Finally, the paper aims to evaluate the model by means of two language-specific corpora. The paper bridges digital libraries, on the one hand, and computational linguistics, on the other. The aim is to make accessible computational linguistic methods to provide thematic classifications in digital libraries based on closed topic models such as the DDC. Design/methodology/approach: The approach takes the form of text classification, text-technology, computational linguistics, computational semantics, and social semantics. Findings: It is shown that SVM-based classifiers perform best by exploring certain selections of OAI document metadata. Research limitations/implications: The findings show that it is necessary to further develop SVM-based DDC-classifiers by using larger training sets possibly for more than two languages in order to get better F-measure values. Originality/value: Algorithmic and formal-mathematical information is provided on how to build DDC-classifiers for digital libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Document management; Modelling",,"Biber, D., (1995) Dimensions of Register Variation: A Cross-Linguistic Comparison, , Cambridge University Press; Bickhard, M.H., Social ontology as convention (2008) Topoi, 27 (1-2), pp. 139-149; Cilibrasi, R.L., Vitanyi, P.M.B., The Google similarity distance (2007) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 19 (3), pp. 370-383; Cramer, I., How well do semantic relatedness measures perform?

More and more calligraphy works are digitized, preserved and exhibited in digital libraries. Users may want to appreciate the style-similar works simultaneously. However, currently available services such as metadata-based browsing and searching can not satisfy such kind of requirement. To allow users to appreciate the style-similar works conveniently, we propose a Supervised Learning Weighted Random Walk Model to discover calligraphy style relationships. In the model, we consider the heterogeneity of both edges and nodes, and then use some preference pairs to learn the weights of different types of edges in the graph. After the weight learning, the style relationships can be discovered by random walk on the heterogeneous graphs. In order to solve the out-of-graph node problem, we pre-compute the personalized vector for each character or visual word, then utilize the Linearity Theory for vector addition to approximate the relationships between the new node and other nodes in graph. Then we demonstrate several applications which prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model and a user study for benefit verification. Finally, we explore some strategies to enhance the performance with the explicit or implicit user interaction including feedback, clickthrough data tracking. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Chinese calligraphy; Feedback; Random walk; Style relationships discovery; Weight learning","Chinese calligraphy; Clickthrough data; Heterogeneous graph; Random walk; Random walk models; Style relationships discovery; User interaction; User study; Vector addition; Visual word; Weight learning; Digital libraries; Education; Metadata; Supervised learning; Graph theory","Agarwal, A., Chakrabarti, S., Learning random walks to rank nodes in graphs (2007) ICML'07: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 9-16. , ACM, New York; Agarwal, A., Chakrabarti, S., Aggarwal, S., Learning to rank networked entities (2006) KDD'06: Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 14-23. , ACM, New York; Chakrabarti, S., Agarwal, A., Learning parameters in entity relationship graphs from ranking preferences (2006) PKDD.

These complexities and dynamics make system maintenance a non-trivial task, since it requires periodical evaluation of the different DL components. Generally, these evaluations are customized per system and are performed only when problems occur and administrator intervention is required. This work aims to change the situation. We present 5SQual, a tool which provides ways to perform automatic and configurable evaluations of some of the most important DL components, among them, digital objects, metadata, and services. The tool implements diverse numeric indicators that are associated with eight quality dimensions described in the 5S quality model. Its generic architecture was developed to be applicable to various DLs and scenarios. In sum, the main contributions of this work include: (i) the design and implementation of 5SQual, a tool that validates a theoretical DL quality model; (ii) the demonstration of the applicability of the tool in several usage scenarios; and (iii) the evaluation (with usability specialists) of its graphical interface specially designed to guide the configuration of 5SQual evaluations. We also present the results of interviews conducted with administrators of real DLs regarding their expectations and opinions about 5SQual. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We then apply that framework to integrate domain-specific (archeological) DLs, illustrating our solutions for key problems in DL integration. An integrated Archeological DL, ETANA-DL, is used as a case study to justify and evaluate our DL integration approach. More specifically, we develop a minimal metamodel for archeological DLs within the 5S theory. We implement the 5SSuite tool set to cover the process of union DL generation, including requirements gathering, conceptual modeling, rapid prototyping, and code generation. 5SSuite consists of 5SGraph, 5SGen, and SchemaMapper, each of which plays an important role in DL integration. We also propose an approach to integrated DLs based on the 5S formalism, which provides a systematic method to design and implement DL exploring services. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Earlier efforts in the DL area have concentrated on metadata harvesting and provisioning of value-added Federated Digital Library (FDL) services to the users. FDL services, however, have to meet significant performance and scalability requirements, which is difficult to achieve in centralized metadata harvesting systems. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the benefits of using Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) compliant grid middleware infrastructure for providing efficient and reliable FDL services. The presented FDL application allows for parallel harvesting of OAI-PMH compliant DLs. The results show that this approach efficiently solves the performance related problems, while it also contributes to greater flexibility of the system. The quality of service is improved as metadata can be updated frequently, and the system does not exhibit a single point of failure. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The author began researching metadata use in Thailand in 2003 and 2004 while on sabbatical from the University of Vermont. A small number of government libraries were in the process of building up their digital databases. These were identified from a survey conducted by the author at that time. The author continues to monitor the development of digital initiatives and has identified several new digital initiatives created by academic institutions since then. The digital initiatives operated by Thai government agencies and academic institutions that existed in 2007 are presented, along with one example of a metadata record randomly selected from each of these projects. These examples illustrate Dublin Core metadata use and cataloguing practice employed in these digital databases. The author's current research on the development of digital initiatives is included. Findings - This paper presents what the author feels are some significant technical and legal issues facing Thai digital initiatives. A major copyright issue in Thailand, the ineffective enforcement of intellectual property laws relating to access rights, is presented. Also discussed is the significant obstacle to record retrieval created by the structure and complexity of the Thai language. Originality/value - This paper identifies important issues and problems related to Thai digital initiatives and offers suggestions and comments aimed at enhancing the development and progress of digital initiatives both in the Thai library community and internationally. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cataloguing; Data collection; Digital libraries; Libraries; Thailand",,"Beall, J., (2005) Metadata and Data Quality Problems in the Digital Library, , http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/jodi-171/68, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Centre, Denver; Siripan, P., Creating vocabulary for Thai database integration (2005) DC-2005, International Conference on Dublin Core metadata and applications, , paper presented, Madrid, September 12-15, 2005, available at: http://dublin.tiac.or.th/doc/DC2005-Thailand.pdf; Tiac, (2006) Annual Reports, , www.tiac.or.th/about%20tiac1report.html, Technical Information Access Center, Prathumthani; Gorman, G.E., Cullen, R., The knowledge model applied to library networks in Asia (2000) Library Consortium Management: An International Journal, 2 (7), pp. 135-44; Siripan, P., Metadata and trends of cataloging in Thailand (1999) 65th IFLA Council and General Conference, , paper presented, August 20-28, 1999, Bangkok, available at: www.ifla.org/IV/ifla65/papers/114-131e.htm",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - Provides a description of an academic digital library's evolution into an institutional repository, accompanied by both practical and philosophical analyses. Findings - Materials supporting an academic institution's scholarship (from colleges and from supporting organizations on campus) can play an important part in the success of an institutional repository. Standards for metadata content, data structures and hierarchies of collections must be followed consistently, and adequate storage for digital media within an institutional repository is necessary to have in advance of anticipated demand for the smooth operation of the IR and continued access to materials. Gray areas between the role of an institutional repository and the role of that organization's archives need to be addressed in the future. Practical implications - Academic libraries can be highly successful in producing an institute repository by developing relationships with various organizations on campus in addition to the academic programs. Maintaining standards throughout the IR is crucial to future growth in an organized and consistent manner. Philosophical considerations of the role of the IR should be addressed in the beginning stages of the development of the IR for eliminating confusion and duplication of its contents with other campus organizations. Originality/value - This paper describes the development of a digital library, created and maintained by an academic library, and its gradual change into a de facto institutional repository. Other libraries in the planning stages or initial steps of creating a campus-wide digital library or an institutional repository can benefit from the description of possible successes and problems that they could encounter during implementation.","Archives management; Digital libraries",,"Buehler, M.A., Boateng, A., ""The evolving impact of institutional repositories on reference librarians"" (2005) Reference Services Review, 33 (3), p. 291; Cervone, H.F., ""The repository adventure"" (2004) Library Journal, 129 (10), pp. 44-46; Hayes, H., (2005) ""Digital Repositories, Helping Universities and Colleges"", , JISC briefing paper, August, Scotland; Pearce-Moses, R., (2005) A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology, , The Society of American Archivists Chicago, IL",Review,Scopus

The scope of the repository, which started with newspaper clippings, has been enhanced to accommodate research papers, speeches/lectures, office orders/memorandums, videos, annual reports and the in-house publications. Design/methodology/approach - A comparative study of the available open source digital library software is made taking into consideration the availability of technical support, possibility of hands on training and the resources available for implementing the IR. Logical approach is made in building different communities, collections and decisions are taken in sharing the responsibility of maintaining different collections. Findings - The paper provides evidence on how the ISRO HQ IR was built from scratch and how different collections with numerous forms and formats can be accommodated using DSpace software. Many problems were faced during customisation of metadata forms for different collections apart from Dublin Core metadata fields. DSpace allows workflow and customisation as per institutional requirements. It supports community/collection based content and submission by different user communities.

For each major DL concept in the framework we formally define a number of dimensions of quality and propose a set of numerical indicators for those quality dimensions. In particular, we consider key concepts of a minimal DL: catalog, collection, digital object, metadata specification, repository, and services. Regarding quality dimensions, we consider: accessibility, accuracy, completeness, composability, conformance, consistency, effectiveness, efficiency, extensibility, pertinence, preservability, relevance, reliability, reusability, significance, similarity, and timeliness. Regarding measurement, we consider characteristics like: response time (with regard to efficiency), cost of migration (with respect to preservability), and number of service failures (to assess reliability). For some key DL concepts, the (quality dimension, numerical indicator) pairs are illustrated through their application to a number of ""real-world"" digital libraries. We also discuss connections between the proposed dimensions of DL quality and an expanded version of a workshop's consensus view of the life cycle of information in digital libraries. Such connections can be used to determine when and where quality issues can be measured, assessed, and improved - as well as how possible quality problems can be prevented, detected, and eliminated. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, libraries have dramatically expanded their e-journal holdings through consortial agreements, publisher licenses, and aggregator subscriptions. User studies show a marked increase in the use of e-journals and a growing reliance on online journals for scholarship and instruction. The increased availability and usage of electronic journals has presented libraries with critical management, bibliographic control, and access problems. This paper explores e-resource management and bibliographic control mechanisms and access solutions, and examines the evolving relationship between e-resource management systems, the online catalog, local link resolvers, and full-text e-journal repositories. To address these interoperability issues, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Library has developed several management and access tools. The Online Research Resources (ORR) combines a relational database, a searchable A-to-Z list, and elements of an electronic resources management system. The Journal and Article Locator (JAL) utilizes metasearch technologies over the ORR, the local OPAC, the local link resolver server, and the CrossRef metadata database to provide unified access to both electronic and print journal holdings and full-text articles. © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The project kopal tackles this problem head-on: in a three-year project kopal's objective is the practical testing and implementation of a cooperatively created and operated long-term archival system for digital resources. Design/methodology/approach - The system will be implementedin accordance with international standards for long-term archiving and metadata within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) framework. The project partners, Die Deutsche Bibliothek (DDB), Göttingen State and University Library (SUB Göttingen), IBM Deutschland GmbH and the Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG), will establish a cooperatively transferable solution for cultural heritage institutions, as well as for business and industry. Findings - Within the project, the project partners DDB and SUB Göttingen are developing software for the input and access of data, which will be released under an open-source license. Research limitations/implications - Long-term preservation methods and strategies will be discussed in general in the paper. Practical implications - The project will present a stable and reusable platform for additional partners and users, especially for cultural heritage organisations. Originality/value - The solution is based on Digital Information and Archiving System (DIAS), jointly devised by IBM and the National Library of The Netherlands in The Hague, and it will be adapted to the needs of the project with several extensions.

Design/methodology/approach - Different categories of digital collections based on guidelines defined by the authors are presented. Issues related to public access are illustrated. A model using the FRBR entities relationships is proposed to improve the accessibility of digital cultural materials so that scholarly research can be enhanced. The number of digital collections has been increased significantly since the late 1990s, but few studies investigated how these collections were organized and managed. To attain an understanding of the current status of institutional digital collections, various collection sites were examined and analyzed. The study focused on the existence and level of richness of bibliographic descriptions provided for each image; whether a search engine was available or not; how easily the search could be performed; and how search results were organized. The presentation of search results is problematic. Applying the IFLA FRBR model to digital materials can bring a solution. Findings - The IFLA FRBR model presents the search results hierarchically so that related materials can be easily collocated. This feature meets the end-users needs. The attributes of work and expression entities presented in the IFLA FRBR model should be applied differently for event-based digital cultural materials. Defining work- or expression-level entities under the event or theme will be more logical than under author and/or title for cultural materials. Doing expression-level cataloging might also work for this type of materials. Originality/value - Before building a digital collection, institutions should have a well-thought-out and well-planned collection management mechanism. Metadata scheme, content standards and content management system are important fundamentals. Much can be done to improve the accessibility of digital collections.

Its metadata are aggregated at a single web site. Six digitization centers at the largest universities in both states digitize their own collections and support partner institutions in their geographic regions. Each center runs a CONTENTdm server, and an aggregating server at the University of Utah harvests metadata into a single searchable index. Local control and identity of collections are hallmarks of the MWDL. Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes the technical structure of the MWDL, focusing on the multi-site server aggregating software from DiMeMa Inc. Findings - The MWDL was the first cooperative digital project to implement this software, and inspired the same infrastructure for a nine-state project known as the Western Waters Digital Library. In 2005 the MWDL will also become the first in the nation to aggregate distributed digital newspaper collections. Practical implications - Describes the creation and aggregation of a distributed regional digital library with digital asset management software that is already in use at over 200 institutions in the US. The solutions implemented in the MWDL offer a mechanism for large and small institutions to work together in a cost-effective manner.

Design/methodology/approach - In conventional solutions, a mediator is adopted to create and maintain the matching between relevant terms such that distinct but relevant metadata schemas can be integrated according to the mapping relationships in the mediator. However, such solutions suffer some problems originated from the static matching in mediator. This paper proposes to use facts to express the relationships among heterogeneous schemas and conduct the reasoning dynamically by using inference engines. Findings - It is justified to use facts and inference engines to express and operate the semantics among heterogeneous but relevant information resources. The user can choose to convert only part of the XML document into facts if she can unpeel deeply nested XML tags. Additionally, it is possible for the user to manually edit (assert, update or retract) the facts as needed in the reasoning. Research limitations/implications - The study assumes that peers are clustered according to shared topics or interest. An exhaust evaluation has not been conducted. Practical implications - Each node can publish its schema to the involved peer community such that other peers can automatically discover the specific schema. A local matchmaking engine is adopted as well in order to automatically generate the relations between its own schema and the retrieved ones.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a range of illustrative examples, we attempt to determine what t defines a virtual museum on the one hand and a digital library disguised as a virtual museum on the other; when it makes sense for virtual museums to work in partnership with digital libraries, or draw on digital library research and development; and how the power of the digital environment might be harnessed to further the traditional values of the museum community. Findings - Finds that virtual museums and digital libraries have much in common and the boundaries between them are increasingly blurred. The provision of object-level metadata, needed to realise the wider potential of the digital environment to enhance and extend the traditional museum experience, gives rise to a number of issues which are shared by libraries and for which shared approaches would be beneficial. In particular, collaboration between the museum and library communities is essential if solutions to the problems of cross-domain searching are to be found and its potential to facilitate new knowledge creation fully exploited. However, any collaborative approach must take into account the differences, as well as the similarities, between the two communities, as these differences are fundamental and defining.

This paper focuses on the approaches taken to address these issues in Arc, an Open Archives Initiative-compliant federated digital library. At present Arc contains over 1M metadata records from 75 data providers from various subject domains. Analysis of these heterogeneous . collections indicates that controlled vocabularies and values are widely used in most repositories. Usage is extremely variable, however. In Arc we solve the problem by implementing an advanced searching interface that allows users to search and select in specific fields with data we construct from the harvested metadata, and also by an interactive search for the subject field. As the metadata records are incrementally harvested we address how to build these services over frequently-added new collections and harvested data. The initial result is promising, showing the benefits of immediate feedback to the user in enhancing the search experience as well as in increasing the precision of fthe user's search.",,"Algorithms; Interoperability; Metadata; Problem solving; Real time systems; Search engines; World Wide Web; Automatic categorization algorithms; Los Alamos National Laboratory; Open Archives Initiative-compliant federated digital library; Searching Interface Techniques; Digital libraries","Bowman, C.M., Danzig, P.B., Hardy, D.R., Manber, U., Schwartz, M.F., The harvest information discovery and access system (1995) Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 28, pp. 119-125; Desai, B.C., Supporting discovery in virtual libraries (1997) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 48, pp. 190-204; Dushay, N., French, J.C., Lagoze, C., A characterization study of NCSTRL distributed searching (1999) Cornell University Computer Science Technical Report, TR99-1725. , http://historical.ncstrl.org/tr/ps/cornellcs/TR99-1725.ps; French, J.C., Powell, A.L., Gey, F., Perelman, N., Exploiting a controlled vocabulary to improve collection selection and retrieval effectiveness (2001) Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 199-206. , Atlanta, Georgia, USA; French, J.C., Powell, A.L., Schulman, E., Pfaltz, J.L., Automating the construction of authority files in digital libraries: A case study (1997) Proceedings of Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries, First European Conference, pp. 55-71. , Pisa, Italy; Gey, F.C., Buckland, M., Chen, A., Larson, R., Entry vocabulary - A technology to enhance digital search (2001) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Human Language Technology, , San Diego, USA; Goldman, R., Widom, J., Interactive query and search in semistructured databases (1998) WebDB'98, Proceedings of the International Workshop on the Web and Databases, pp. 42-48; Gravano, L., Chang, K., Garcia-Molina, H., Lagoze, C., Paepcke, A., STARTS: Stanford proposal for internet meta-searching (1997) Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 207-218; Koch, T., Neuroth, H., Day, M., Renardus: Cross-browsing European subject gateways via a common classification system (DDC) (2001) IFLA Satellite Meeting: Subject Retrieval in a Networked Environment, , http://www.lub.lu.se/~traugott/drafts/preifla-final.html, OCLC, Dublin, OH, USA; Koster, M., The Web Robots Page, , http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html; Lagoze, C., Van de Sompel, H., The open archives initiative: Building a low-barrier interoperability framework (2001) Proceedings of the First ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 54-62. , http://www.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/papers/oai-final.pdf, Roanoke, VA; Lee-Smeltzer, K.H., Finding the needle: Controlled vocabularies, resource discovery, and Dublin Core (2000) Library Collections, Acquisitions, & Technical Services, 24, pp. 205-215; Levy, A.Y., Rajaraman, A., Ordille, J., Querying heterogeneous information sources using source descriptions (1996) Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 251-262; Lindberg, D., Humphreys, B., McCray, A., Unified medical language systems (1993) Methods of Information in Medicine, 32 (4), pp. 281-291; Liu, X., Maly, K., Zubair, M., Nelson, M.L., Arc - An OAI service provider for digital library federation (2001) D-lib Magazine, 7 (4). , http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april01/liu/041iu.html; Maa, M.-H., Esler, S.L., Nelson, M.L., Lyceum: A multi-protocol digital library gateway (1997) NASA TM-112871, , http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/PDF/1997/tm/NASA-97-tm112871.pdf; Mahoney, D., Giacomo, M.D., Flashpoint@LANL.gov: A simple smart search interface (2001) Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship, , http://www.istl.org/istl/01-summer/article2.html, Summer, 2001; Reese, G., (2000) Database Programming with JDBC and Java, , Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates; Shivakumar, P., Sample NCSTRL usability evaluation report (2002) Virginia Tech Computer Science Technical Report, TR02-08; Schwartz, M., (1996) Report of W3C Distributed Indexing and Searching Workshop, , http://web3.w3.org/Search/9605-Indexing-Workshop; Weibel, S., Kunze, J., Lagoze, C., Wolfe, M., Dublin Core metadata for resource discovery (1998) Internet RFC-2413, , http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2413.txt; Zubair, M., Maly, K., Ameerally, I., Nelson, M.L., Dynamic construction of federated digital libraries (2000) Proceedings of WWW9 Conference, , http://www9.org/final-posters/poster17.html, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Review,Scopus
"Letourneau F., Bedard Y., Moulin B.","Prospects for the use of the data warehouse concept for Georeferenced Digital Libraries on the Internet [Perspectives d'utilisation du concept d'entrepot de donnees pour les georepertoires dans Internet]",1998,"Geomatica",52,2,,145,163,,,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0031792261&partnerID=40&md5=032e3cd88139af167e8ce671dbc64275","The implementation by different organizations of Georeferenced Digital Libraries (GDL) on the World Wide Web creates several problems for users who must query these heterogeneous libraries for a given territory. They face differences in contents, structures, spatial reference systems, semantics, interfaces, etc. In addition, these GDLs usually do not provide on-line support for the users who want to select the best products according to his needs. Our solution to these problems is to import some metadata from these GDLs, to process their data and to integrate the results in an homogeneous spatial data warehouse which serves as a 'one-stop' query engine. Such solution is known in computer sciences as 'data warehousing' and is theoretically very promising. However, there was a high level of uncertainty with regard to such a solution: conceptually, operationally and technically. Consequently, we started a research and development project to further study these theoretical possibilities and to experiment the resulting concepts. This resulted in a prototype called SOSSD (System for the Optimal Selection of Spatial Data) developed by the main author for his M.Sc., with the two co-authors as advisors. This paper presents our theoretical approach as well as the results obtained with SOSSD, including the implementation of a spatial data warehouse on the Web and the use of 'fuzzy logic' to support the users in their queries.",,"digital library; Internet","http://www.anzlic.org.au/, Norme ANZLICBédard, Y., Larrivée, S., Proulx, M.J., Caron, R.-Y., Létourneau, F., Lam, S., (1997) Geospatial Data Warehousing : Positionnement Technologique et Stratégique, 79p. , Centre de recherche en géomatique.
