"Zavalina O.L.","Subject Access: Conceptual Models, Functional Requirements, and Empirical Data",2012,"Journal of Library Metadata",12,2-3,,140,163,,1,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866660377&partnerID=40&md5=630fd8755f0d418d95b4a8ccd0b50540","One of the central functions of bibliographic control is providing subject access. However, numerous studies conducted over decades have shown that users routinely experience problems with subject access in library catalogs and databases. These problems are often due to inadequate quality of subject metadata, which is greatly influenced by complexity of subject representation. The fact that major cataloging standards (e.g., AACR2 and its predecessors) have been overlooking the importance of subject access and have not addressed subject cataloging is arguably one of the reasons behind problems in organization of subject access. The new cataloging code-Resource Description and Access (RDA)-attempts to fill this gap. Upon examination of how subject access is addressed in RDA and its underlying conceptual models that specify functional requirements for bibliographic control-FRBR, FRAD, and FRSAD-this article presents results of a study that used FRBR model as an analytical framework in examination of user search queries in a large-scale digital library. The findings of this study provide empirical data to inform the development of RDA sections that cover subject access, particularly subject entities and relationships. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bibliographic control; conceptual models; digital libraries; entity-relationship models; FRAD; FRBR; FRSAD; RDA; subject access; transaction log analysis; user searching",,"Allen, B., Cognitive research in information science: Implications for design (1991) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 26, pp. 3-37; Bates, M., The Getty end-user online searching project in the humanities: Report no. 6-Overview and conclusions (1996) College & Research Libraries, 57, pp. 514-523; Bates, M., Indexing and access for digital libraries and the Internet: Human, database, and domain factors (1998) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49 (13), pp. 1185-1205; Bates, M., Subject access in online catalogs: A design model (1986) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 37 (6), pp. 357-376; Beghtol, C., Bibliographic classification theory and text linguistics: Aboutness analysis, intertextuality and the cognitive act of classifying documents (1986) Journal of Documentation, 42 (2), pp. 84-113; Beitzel, S., Jensen, E., Chowdhury, A., Frieder, O., Grossman, D., Temporal analysis of a very large topically categorized Web query log (2007) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58 (2), pp. 166-178; Borgman, C., Why are online catalogs still hard to use?

In spite of this rapid growth, users experience high levels of frustration when searching for the desired image. Even though new images are profitable to the service providers, traditional collaborative filtering methods cannot recommend them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose feature-based collaborative filtering (FBCF) method to reflect the user's most recent preference by representing his purchase sequence in the visual feature space. The proposed approach represents the images that have been purchased in the past as the feature clusters in the multi-dimensional feature space and then selects neighbors by using an inter-cluster distance function between their feature clusters. Various experiments using real image data demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a higher quality recommendation and better performance than do typical collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. © 2009 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Collaborative filtering; Feature clustering; Image segmentation; Recommendation; Region-based image retrieval","Catalog services; Collaborative filtering; Collaborative filtering methods; Content based filtering; Distance functions; Feature clustering; Feature space; Feature-based; Image content; Mobile phone services; Multimedia contents; Purchase sequences; Rapid expansion; Rapid growth; Real image data; Recommendation algorithms; Region-based image retrieval; Service provider; Visual feature; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; Image retrieval; Multimedia services; Profitability; Signal filtering and prediction; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone systems; Image segmentation","Barnard, K., Duygulu, P., Guru, R., Gabbur, P., Forsyth, D., The effects of segmentation and feature choice in a translation model of object recognition (2003) Proc.

Unfortunately, cataloguing these materials involves manual work and updates of the cataloguing records will not be made easily and quickly enough in the future. This paper aims to tackle these cataloguing problems and to inform about the latest developments and accomplishments in the field of accessible materials. The paper also stresses the importance of profiling cataloguing issues for libraries for the visually-impaired within the cataloguing community. Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with an overview of the field of accessible materials and gives an account of certain cataloguing problems. Then follows a detailed description of these cataloguing issues before the paper concludes with a suggested method and a description of a practical workflow to counter the listed problems. The paper is, in a sense, a case study of a trend in the field of librarianship regarding technologies for the visually-impaired. Findings - The paper shows that a dynamic cataloguing solution is necessary to meet the growing number of dynamic digital materials for libraries that produce accessible materials. Practical implications - Implementation of the suggested dynamic cataloguing solution results in less manual work while allowing large scale updates of a digital archive.

With CADNA the numerical quality of any simulation program can be controlled. Furthermore by detecting all the instabilities which may occur at run time, a numerical debugging of the user code can be performed. CADNA provides new numerical types on which round-off errors can be estimated. Slight modifications are required to control a code with CADNA, mainly changes in variable declarations, input and output. This paper describes the features of the CADNA library and shows how to interpret the information it provides concerning round-off error propagation in a code. Program summary: Program title:CADNA. Catalogue identifier:AEAT_v1_0. Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEAT_v1_0.html. Program obtainable from:CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland.

Computer:PC running LINUX with an i686 or an ia64 processor, UNIX workstations including SUN, IBM. Operating system:LINUX, UNIX. Classification:4.14, 6.5, 20. Nature of problem:A simulation program which uses floating-point arithmetic generates round-off errors, due to the rounding performed at each assignment and at each arithmetic operation. Round-off error propagation may invalidate the result of a program. The CADNA library enables one to estimate round-off error propagation in any simulation program and to detect all numerical instabilities that may occur at run time. Solution method:The CADNA library [1] implements Discrete Stochastic Arithmetic [2-4] which is based on a probabilistic model of round-off errors. The program is run several times with a random rounding mode generating different results each time. From this set of results, CADNA estimates the number of exact significant digits in the result that would have been computed with standard floating-point arithmetic. Restrictions:CADNA requires a Fortran 90 (or newer) compiler. In the program to be linked with the CADNA library, round-off errors on complex variables cannot be estimated. Furthermore array functions such as product or sum must not be used. Only the arithmetic operators and the abs, min, max and sqrt functions can be used for arrays. Running time:The version of a code which uses CADNA runs at least three times slower than its floating-point version. This cost depends on the computer architecture and can be higher if the detection of numerical instabilities is enabled. In this case, the cost may be related to the number of instabilities detected.

Design/methodology/approach - The author began researching metadata use in Thailand in 2003 and 2004 while on sabbatical from the University of Vermont. A small number of government libraries were in the process of building up their digital databases. These were identified from a survey conducted by the author at that time. The author continues to monitor the development of digital initiatives and has identified several new digital initiatives created by academic institutions since then. The digital initiatives operated by Thai government agencies and academic institutions that existed in 2007 are presented, along with one example of a metadata record randomly selected from each of these projects. These examples illustrate Dublin Core metadata use and cataloguing practice employed in these digital databases. The author's current research on the development of digital initiatives is included. Findings - This paper presents what the author feels are some significant technical and legal issues facing Thai digital initiatives. A major copyright issue in Thailand, the ineffective enforcement of intellectual property laws relating to access rights, is presented. Also discussed is the significant obstacle to record retrieval created by the structure and complexity of the Thai language. Originality/value - This paper identifies important issues and problems related to Thai digital initiatives and offers suggestions and comments aimed at enhancing the development and progress of digital initiatives both in the Thai library community and internationally. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cataloguing; Data collection; Digital libraries; Libraries; Thailand",,"Beall, J., (2005) Metadata and Data Quality Problems in the Digital Library, , http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/jodi-171/68, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Centre, Denver; Siripan, P., Creating vocabulary for Thai database integration (2005) DC-2005, International Conference on Dublin Core metadata and applications, , paper presented, Madrid, September 12-15, 2005, available at: http://dublin.tiac.or.th/doc/DC2005-Thailand.pdf; Tiac, (2006) Annual Reports, , www.tiac.or.th/about%20tiac1report.html, Technical Information Access Center, Prathumthani; Gorman, G.E., Cullen, R., The knowledge model applied to library networks in Asia (2000) Library Consortium Management: An International Journal, 2 (7), pp. 135-44; Siripan, P., Metadata and trends of cataloging in Thailand (1999) 65th IFLA Council and General Conference, , paper presented, August 20-28, 1999, Bangkok, available at: www.ifla.org/IV/ifla65/papers/114-131e.htm",Article,Scopus

It aims to discuss this search engine, which is intended exclusively for searching scholarly documents, and then empirically test its most important functionality. The focus is on an exploratory study which investigates the coverage of scientific serials in GS. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on queries against different journal lists: international scientific journals from Thomson Scientific (SCI, SSCI, AH), open access journals from the DOAJ list and journals from the German social sciences literature database SOLIS as well as the analysis of result data from GS. All data gathering took place in August 2006. Findings - The study shows deficiencies in the coverage and up-to-dateness of the GS index. Furthermore, the study points out which web servers are the most important data providers for this search service and which information sources are highly represented. The paper can show that there is a relatively large gap in Google Scholar's coverage of German literature as well as weaknesses in the accessibility of Open Access content. Major commercial academic publishers are currently the main data providers. Research limitations/implications - Five different journal lists were analysed, including approximately 9,500 single titles. The lists are from different fields and of various sizes. This limits comparability. There were also some problems matching the journal titles of the original lists to the journal title data provided by Google Scholar. The study was only able to analyse the top 100 Google Scholar hits per journal. Practical implications - The paper concludes that Google Scholar has some interesting pros (such as citation analysis and free materials) but the service cannot be seen as a substitute for the use of special abstracting and indexing databases and library catalogues due to various weaknesses (such as transparency, coverage and up-to-dateness). Originality/value - The authors do not know of any other study using such a brute force approach and such a large empirical basis. The study can be considered as using brute force in the sense that it gathered lots of data from Google and then analysed the data in a macroscopic way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Electronic journals; Search engines; Serials; Worldwide web","Abstracting; Data reduction; Database systems; Search engines; Social sciences; Web services; Websites; Electronic journals; Google Scholar (GS); Serials; Digital libraries","Banks, M.A., The excitement of Google Scholar, the worry of Google Print (2005) Biomedical Digital Libraries, 2 (2). , available at: www.bio-diglib.com/content/2/1/2; Bar-Ilan, J., An ego-centric citation analysis of the works of Michael O.

This phenomenon is also occurring in the academic information resource market of Korea. As a result, it is necessary to positively review linking library services with search portals. In particular, a plan to link the services of university libraries (which are recognized as private facilities of universities) is needed, utilizing them actively as public facilities connected with the local community. In this context, this study discusses a model to link the Korean University Library OPAC with search portals. Design/methodology/approach - Analyzes the present status of cases in foreign countries - already vigorously active - and raise several points. In consideration of analysis, sets basic directions about linking library OPAC to search portals. Proposes a detailed model to link search portals with University Library Union Catalogs and manifestation of Deeplink to local University Library OPAC in consideration of technical situation of Korean Library OPACs. Findings - A major problem from established cases is that portal search engines cover all areas so retrieval results are generally vast. Users cannot easily find a path accessing library resources through search portals without special equipment. Originality/value - This paper proposes models to link library catalogs through special sub domains or book services of portal sites using University Library Union Catalogs as a gateway.

For each major DL concept in the framework we formally define a number of dimensions of quality and propose a set of numerical indicators for those quality dimensions. In particular, we consider key concepts of a minimal DL: catalog, collection, digital object, metadata specification, repository, and services. Regarding quality dimensions, we consider: accessibility, accuracy, completeness, composability, conformance, consistency, effectiveness, efficiency, extensibility, pertinence, preservability, relevance, reliability, reusability, significance, similarity, and timeliness. Regarding measurement, we consider characteristics like: response time (with regard to efficiency), cost of migration (with respect to preservability), and number of service failures (to assess reliability). For some key DL concepts, the (quality dimension, numerical indicator) pairs are illustrated through their application to a number of ""real-world"" digital libraries. We also discuss connections between the proposed dimensions of DL quality and an expanded version of a workshop's consensus view of the life cycle of information in digital libraries. Such connections can be used to determine when and where quality issues can be measured, assessed, and improved - as well as how possible quality problems can be prevented, detected, and eliminated. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Nature of problem:The program allows the classification of N ≥ 1 supersymmetric nonlinear scaling-invariant evolution equations {f t = φ f, b t = φ b} that admit infinitely many local symmetries propagated by recursion operators; here b (x, t ; θ) is the set of bosonic super-fields and f (x ; t ; θ) are fermionic super-fields. Solution method:First, (half-)integer weights | f |, | b |, ..., | D t |, | D x | ≡ 1 are assigned to all variables and derivatives and then pairs of commuting flows that are homogeneous w.r.t. these weights are constructed. Secondly, the seeds of higher symmetry sequences [P.J. Olver, Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations, second ed., Springer, Berlin, 1993] for the systems are sorted out, and finally the recursion operators that generate the symmetries are obtained [I.S. Krasil'shchik, P.H.M. Kersten, Symmetries and Recursion Operators for Classical and Supersymmetric Differential Equations, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 2000]. The intermediate algebraic systems upon the undetermined coefficients are solved by using [T. Wolf, Applications of Crack in the classification of integrable systems, in: CRM Proc. Lecture Notes, vol. 37, 2004, pp. 283-300]. Restrictions:Computation of symmetries of high differential order for very large evolutionary systems may cause memory restrictions. Additional size/time restrictions may occur if the homogeneity weights of some super-fields are non-positive, see Section 1.2. Unusual features:SsTools has been extensively tested using hundreds of PDE systems within three years on UNIX-based PC-machines. SsTools is applicable to the computation of symmetries, conservation laws, and Hamiltonian structures for N ≥ 1 evolutionary super-systems with any N. SsTools is also useful for performing extensive arithmetic of general nature including differentiations of super-field expressions. Running time:Depends on the size and complexity of the input system and varies between seconds and minutes.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis focuses on the 27 libraries with journals that answered a survey, and impact is evaluated by means of the survey's closed and open questions. This research covers the following aspects: selection and acquisition, human resources, technical processes, informatics, marketing, users services, library cooperation, and publishing. Findings - The research outlines the extent to which electronic reference services are being used in Argentina, and the analysis reveals reasons why leading private academic libraries have included electronic journals in their collections. The number of universities granting access to electronic journals has increased slowly over the last five years, though libraries count on a rich variety of electronic journals subscriptions - particularly databases. There is a lack of uniformity with regard to the adoption of standard criteria for cataloguing electronic journals - though over 50 percent said they did catalogue them. Originality/value - Although the study is limited to the Argentine private academic library system, it provides further insight into the realities of private academic libraries in Argentina regarding access, use, and publishing of electronic journals - which, because of the inherent problems of duplication and cost, pose a great challenge to information professionals today.","Academic libraries; Argentina; Electronic journals; Library management","Database systems; Information management; Information services; Electronic journals; Electronic reference services; Library management; Digital libraries","(1998) Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, , American Library Association American Library Association, Chicago, IL; (2002) Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, , American Library Association 2nd ed., American Library Association, Chicago, IL; (2003) ""El Portal Argentino Del Conocimiento Científico"", , www.biblioteca.secyt.gov.ar, Biblioteca Electrónica de Ciencia y Tecnología available at: (accessed 27 May 2005); Bustos González, A., ""Metodología para la evaluación de revistas científicas electrónicas"" (2000) Simposio Electrónico De Revistas Electrónicas, 1o, p. 5. , Buenos Aires, September 11-October 6; ""Consejo de Rectores de Universidades Privadas"" (2003) Biblioteca Virtual, , www.crup.org.ar/, Consejo de Rectores de Universidades Privadas available at:; Deveze, G., ""Uso de la biblioteca digital: El caso de la Universidad de Palermo"" (2003) Jornada Sobre La Biblioteca Digital Universitaria, , www.amicus.udesa.edu.ar/1bibliotecadigital/JBD_DEVEZE%20PALERMO.htm, 1o, Buenos Aires, June available at: (accessed 27 May 2005); Giordanino, E.P., ""Revistas electrónicas: Vino nuevo en odres nuevos"" (2001) Simposio Electrónico De Revistas Electrónicas, , 2o Buenos Aires, June; Gómez, N., ""Comentarios durante el Simposio Electrónico las revistas electrónicas"" (2000) Simposio Electrónico Las Revistas Electrónicas, , 1o, Buenos Aires, September 11-October 6; Guillén, K., Alonso Reyes, R., ""Las revistas electrónicas: Impacto en los usuarios de la información en Camaguey (Cuba)"" (2000) Información, Cultura Y Sociedad, (2), pp. 71-83; ""International standard bibliographic description for serials"" (1999), www.ifla.org/VII/s13/pubs/isbd.htm, International Federation of Library Associations International Federation of Library Associations, London, available at(2006) ""The Scholarly Journal Archive"", , www.jstor.org, JSTOR available at; Luther, J., ""Full text journal subscriptions: An evolutionary process"" (1997) ARL Directory of Electronic Newsletters and Academic Discussion List, , http://db.arl.org/luther.html, available at; Martino, L., Pandiello Pascua, A.M., ""La capacitación de usuarios de la biblioteca digital: El caso de la Universidad del Salvador"" (2003) Jornada Sobre La Biblioteca Digital Universitaria, , www.amicus.udesa.edu.ar/1bibliotecadigital/JBD_USAL.htm, 1o, Buenos Aires, June available at; Munster, I., ""La crisis de las bibliotecas universitarias argentinas"" (2003) SALALM, , 1o, Cartagena Colombia; (2000) ""Electronic Journals & Newsletters"", , http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/NewJourWel.html, available at; Patalano, M., ""Análisis de los sitios web de las bibliotecas universitarias argentinas"" (2002) El Profesional De La Información, 11 (2), pp. 102-110; Ramos Simón, L.F., (2003) El Impacto De Las Publicaciones Electrónicas En Las Bibliotecas Universitarias, , Universidad Complutense de Madrid Madrid; Rodríguez, A., ""La experiencia de la UNAM en la selección, adquisición y administración de revistas electrónicas de texto completo, Infodiversidad"" (2001) Sociedad De Investigaciones Bibliotecológicas, 3, pp. 21-35; Rogers, S.A., ""Electronic journal usage at Ohio State University"" (2001) College & Research Libraries, p. 25. , January; (2006) ""Scientific Electronic Library Online"", , www.scielo.br, SCIELO available at",Article,Scopus

In addition, libraries have dramatically expanded their e-journal holdings through consortial agreements, publisher licenses, and aggregator subscriptions. User studies show a marked increase in the use of e-journals and a growing reliance on online journals for scholarship and instruction. The increased availability and usage of electronic journals has presented libraries with critical management, bibliographic control, and access problems. This paper explores e-resource management and bibliographic control mechanisms and access solutions, and examines the evolving relationship between e-resource management systems, the online catalog, local link resolvers, and full-text e-journal repositories. To address these interoperability issues, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Library has developed several management and access tools. The Online Research Resources (ORR) combines a relational database, a searchable A-to-Z list, and elements of an electronic resources management system. The Journal and Article Locator (JAL) utilizes metasearch technologies over the ORR, the local OPAC, the local link resolver server, and the CrossRef metadata database to provide unified access to both electronic and print journal holdings and full-text articles. © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - Different categories of digital collections based on guidelines defined by the authors are presented. Issues related to public access are illustrated. A model using the FRBR entities relationships is proposed to improve the accessibility of digital cultural materials so that scholarly research can be enhanced. The number of digital collections has been increased significantly since the late 1990s, but few studies investigated how these collections were organized and managed. To attain an understanding of the current status of institutional digital collections, various collection sites were examined and analyzed. The study focused on the existence and level of richness of bibliographic descriptions provided for each image; whether a search engine was available or not; how easily the search could be performed; and how search results were organized. The presentation of search results is problematic. Applying the IFLA FRBR model to digital materials can bring a solution. Findings - The IFLA FRBR model presents the search results hierarchically so that related materials can be easily collocated. This feature meets the end-users needs. The attributes of work and expression entities presented in the IFLA FRBR model should be applied differently for event-based digital cultural materials. Defining work- or expression-level entities under the event or theme will be more logical than under author and/or title for cultural materials. Doing expression-level cataloging might also work for this type of materials. Originality/value - Before building a digital collection, institutions should have a well-thought-out and well-planned collection management mechanism. Metadata scheme, content standards and content management system are important fundamentals. Much can be done to improve the accessibility of digital collections.

The aim of this study is to learn about and evaluate the use made by researchers of the OPAC of the library network of the Spanish Council for Scientific Research, the largest research institution in Spain. Design/methodology/approach - To this end a quest ionnaire was drafted with questions pertaining both to the system and to the users themselves. The information gathered was supplemented by data obtained from the transaction logs. Findings - The results have revealed the use made of the OPAC and the characteristics of the searches performed. Users are still confronted by classic problems of information seeking: information overload, errors in subject searching, and the predominant use of the system's simpler options. The results show that the OPAC is broadly used by end-users not only for obtaining printed material, but also for connecting to the electronic resources subscribed to by the library. Originality/value - The OPAC should continue to occupy an important position in the library's overall information environment, interacting with other information systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Online catalogues; Research organizations; Spain; User studies","Digital libraries; Information retrieval; Online searching; Research; Societies and institutions; Library network; Online public access catalogue (OPAC); Research organizations; Spain; Online systems","Borgman, C.L., ""Why are online catalogs hard to use?

The framework is composed of Grid Case library Service (GCS), Case library Node Management Service (CNMS), Grid Case library Service Registry (GCSR) and Case Library Aggregation Service (CLAS). Firstly, we present a high-level overview of the design and the general characteristics associated with the implementation of those core components. Subsequently, the inner work process of each component and their correlations are illustrated. Finally, a case of a user application is applied to demonstrate the implementation of the grid-based case library. In addition, an organizing scheme structured in catalogs and archives is developed to design auto-body panel die-design case library. By using grid technology, this work has solved the principal problems existing in current case libraries. For example, the applications are restricted to small enterprises, and it is difficult to realize large-scale share among heterogeneous case libraries distributed geographically. Consequently, we anticipate that auto-body panel die-design case library based on grid will be broadly utilized in the making of auto-body panel dies.","Auto-body panel; Case Library; Die; Grid; Grid service; OGSA","Automobile instrument panels; Cache memory; Digital libraries; Information services; Relational database systems; Virtual reality; Auto-body panel die design; Case library aggregation service (CLAS); Case library node management service (CNMS); Grid based design; Grid case library service (GCS); Grid case library service registry (GCSR); Computer aided design","Wang, D., Wu, Z., Hu, P., Key techniques to distributed die design case library (2005) Journal of Jilin University, 35, pp. 314-318. , (Engineering and Technology Edition), May; Foster, I., Argonne, Kishimoto, H., (2005) The Open Grid Services Architecture, , Version 1.0, Jan. 29; Ferreira, L., Berstis, V., Armstrong, J., Kendzierski, M., Takagi, M., Bing-Wo, R., (2003) Introduction to Grid Computing With Globus, , Ibm.com/redbooks, Sep. ch. 12; Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Nick, J., Tueck, S., The Physiology of the Grid: An Open Grid Services Architecture for Distributed Systems, , http://www.gridforum.org/, Available; Allcock, W., Bester, J., Bresnahan, J., Chervenak, A., Liming, L., Tuecke, S., (2001) GridFTP: Protocol Extensions to FTP for the Grid, pp. 1-21. , March; Jacob, B., Ferreira, L., Bieberstein, N., Gilzean, C., Girard, J.-Y., Strachowski, R., Yu, S., (2003) Enabling Applications for Grid Computing With Globus, pp. 148-155. , (Steve) Ibm.com/redbooks, June; Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Nick, J.M., (2002) Grid Service for Distributed System Integration, pp. 37-46. , The new net, IEEE; Sotomayor, B., The Globus Toolkit 3 Programmer's Tutorial, , http://gdp.globus.org/gt3-tutorial/, [Online].

The method is applied for the first time to a double exchange model with finite Hund coupling and also to diluted spin-fermion models.

Method of solution: Typically an exact diagonalization of the electronic sector is performed in this type of models for each configuration of classical fields, which are integrated using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm. A polynomial expansion of the density of states is able to replace the exact diagonalization, decreasing the computational complexity of the problem from O(N4) to O(N) and allowing for the study of larger lattices and more complex and realistic systems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These three methods were compared by means of an evaluation of an online library catalogue, which involved four points of comparison: number and type of usability problems detected; relevance of the problems detected; overall task performance; and participant experiences. The results of the study showed that there were only few significant differences between the usability test approaches, mainly with respect to manner of problem detecting, task performance and participant experience. For the most part, the usability methods proved very much comparable, revealing similar numbers and types of problems that were equally relevant. Taking some practical aspects into account, a case can be made for preferring the concurrent think-aloud protocols over the other two methods. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The physics involved is that of producing the SCE description of molecular electronic densities, of molecular electrostatic potentials and of molecular perturbed potentials due to a point negative or positive charge. This new revision of the program has been optimized to run in serial as well as in parallel execution mode, to support a larger set of molecular symmetries and to permit the restart of long-lasting calculations. To measure the performance of this new release, a comparative study has been carried out on the most powerful computing architectures in serial and parallel runs. The results of the calculations reported in this paper refer to real cases medium to large molecular systems and they are reported in full details to benchmark at best the parallel architectures the new SCELib code will run on. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It then explores some of the problems and issues involved in creating and maintaining a digital library, depending on the characteristics one wants it to have. The paper stresses the need to consider the requirements of scholarship and research as we build the digital libraries of the future.",,"Communication systems; Computer science; Computer software; Control systems; Education; Electronic mail; Information retrieval; Information science; Problem solving; Search engines; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Alta Vista (CO); Cataloging; Forgeries; Scholarly communication; Digital libraries","(1996) KOLISS DL '96: International Conference on Digital Libraries and Information Services for the 21st Century, , An earlier version of this paper was delivered September 10-13, Seoul, Korea; Email address: harter@indiana.eduAtkins, D.E., Birmingham, W.P., Durfee, E.H., Glover, E.J., Mullen, T., Rundensteiner, E.A., Soloway, E., Wellman, M.P., (1996) Toward Inquiry-based Education Through Interacting Software Agents; Winograd, T., Digital vs. libraries: Bridging the two cultures (1995) SIGIR '95: Proceedings of the 18th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 18, p. 2; Internet public library: Same metaphors, new service (1997) American Libraries, pp. 56-59; Miksa, F., The cultural legacy of the ""modern library"" for the future (1996) Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, 37, pp. 100-119; Wallace, J., The internet is a library Sex, Laws, and Cyberspace Bulletin, 1; Bush, V., As we may think (1945) Atlantic Monthly, 176, pp. 101-108; Licklider, J.C.R., (1965) Libraries of the Future, , Cambridge, Mass.: M.I.T.
