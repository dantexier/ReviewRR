A problem that educators face is that no review process similar to the formal adoption processes used for K-12 textbooks or the college-textbook review process exists for these types of online educational resources. However, educators need authoritative high-quality digital teaching materials. The scientific journal peer-review system offers a well-established model to adapt to the requirements of a peer review of educational materials. In this paper, we review ten review processes developed to evaluate digital geoscience educational resources and focus in detail on a rigorous iterative peer-review process recently developed by the Climate Literacy and Energy Awareness Network (CLEAN) project. This process builds upon existing efforts and emphasizes the ""curation"" of a digital collection that addresses the Essential Principles of Climate Literacy and the Energy Literacy Principles. Providing educators with thoroughly reviewed educational materials is especially important for fast changing, societally important, and sensitive areas such as climate and energy science. © 2012 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.","Climate education; Climate literacy essential principles; Digital collection; Digital library; Educational resources; Energy education; Energy literacy principles; Peer-review process","education; literacy; teaching; textbook; twenty first century","Aivazian, B.L., Geary, E., Khoo, M., Sumner, T., Ireton, S., Serving K-12 education with DWEL: Knowledge quest (2003) Journal of American Association of School Librarians, 31 (3), pp. 21-22; Arko, R.A., Ginger, K.M., Kastens, K.A., Weatherley, J., Using annotations to add value to the digital library for education (2006) D-Lib Magazine, 12 (5). , http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may06/arko/05arko.html#Top, Available at, accessed 2 May 2012; Bangay, C., Blum, N., Education response to climate change and quality: Two parts of the same agenda?

Unfortunately, this growth is accompanied by many threats. Digital content (of the e- resources) is fragile and not durable. Its accessibility and use by future generations depends on technology which very rapidly evolves and changes. Hence, ensuring access of e-resources for future generation of users is a big challenge for libraries. The present paper highlights various problems of digital content and elaborates how digital preservation is more demanding and challenging than preserving print copies of journals. It also gives a bird's eye view of various projects initiated for archiving digital content of scholarly journals. © 2012, DESIDOC.","Digital archiving; Digital library; Digital preservation; e-resources; Electronic resources",,"http://www.loc.gov/ac/devpol/electronicresources.pdf(2003) EPIC Faculty Survey, , http://www.epic.columbia.edu/eval/find07/find07.html; Kenney, A.R., Entlich, R., Hirtle, P.B., McGovern, N.Y., Buckley, E.L., (2006) E-journal archiving metes and bounds: A survey of the landscape., , http://www.clir.org/pub/abstract/pub138abst.html, Council on Library and Information Resources, Washington, DC, accessed on 21 June 2012; Kirchhoff, A.J., Expanding the preservation network: Lessons from Portico (2009) Library Trends, 57 (3), pp. 476-498; Lippincott, J.K., Information commons: Meeting millennial needs (2010) J.

However, few studies examine the problem of ranking objects in these networks. In this paper, we study this problem and present a novel model, called PAV, for ranking heterogeneous objects, such as authors, papers, and venues. Based on PAV model, we transform the problem of ranking objects into the problem of estimating probability distribution. We propose an efficient algorithm to estimate probability parameters by use of the fact that the PAV model is a regular Markov chain. For evaluating PAV model, we apply it on one real dataset, which was crawled from ACM Digital Library. The experimental results show that the proposed model is effective. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, a number of network services have compiled databases from the public resources scattered over the Internet. However, publications by different conferences and journals adopt different citation styles. It is an interesting problem to accurately extract metadata from a citation string which is formatted in one of thousands of different styles. It has attracted a great deal of attention in research in recent years. In this paper, based on the notion of sequence alignment, we present a citation parser called BibPro that extracts components of a citation string. To demonstrate the efficacy of BibPro, we conducted experiments on three benchmark data sets. The results show that BibPro achieved over 90 percent accuracy on each benchmark. Even with citations and associated metadata retrieved from the web as training data, our experiments show that BibPro still achieves a reasonable performance.","Data integration; digital libraries; information extraction; sequence alignment","Academic publications; Benchmark data; Data integration; Growing demand; information extraction; Network services; Public resources; Sequence alignments; Training data; Digital libraries; Experiments; Metadata; Alignment","Lee, D., Kang, J., Mitra, P., Giles, C.L., On, B.-W., Are your citations clean?

Design/methodology/approach: Text mining techniques were used to identify duplicate references. Moreover, the process of identifying syntactically different data was improved with the automated discovery of thesauri from correctly matched data, and the generated thesaurus was further used in semantic clustering. The results were effectively visually represented. Findings: The paper finds that the function based on the Jaro-Winkler algorithm may be efficiently used in the de-duplication process. A generated thesaurus that utilises domain-specific knowledge can also be used in the semantic clustering of references. It was shown that semantic clustering may be most useful in partitioning data, which is particularly significant when dealing with large amounts of data, which is usually the case. Moreover, those references that have the same or similar scores may be considered as candidate matches in the further de-duplication process. Finally, it proved to be a more efficient way of visually representing the results.

It aims to discuss this search engine, which is intended exclusively for searching scholarly documents, and then empirically test its most important functionality. The focus is on an exploratory study which investigates the coverage of scientific serials in GS. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on queries against different journal lists: international scientific journals from Thomson Scientific (SCI, SSCI, AH), open access journals from the DOAJ list and journals from the German social sciences literature database SOLIS as well as the analysis of result data from GS. All data gathering took place in August 2006. Findings - The study shows deficiencies in the coverage and up-to-dateness of the GS index. Furthermore, the study points out which web servers are the most important data providers for this search service and which information sources are highly represented. The paper can show that there is a relatively large gap in Google Scholar's coverage of German literature as well as weaknesses in the accessibility of Open Access content. Major commercial academic publishers are currently the main data providers. Research limitations/implications - Five different journal lists were analysed, including approximately 9,500 single titles. The lists are from different fields and of various sizes. This limits comparability. There were also some problems matching the journal titles of the original lists to the journal title data provided by Google Scholar. The study was only able to analyse the top 100 Google Scholar hits per journal. Practical implications - The paper concludes that Google Scholar has some interesting pros (such as citation analysis and free materials) but the service cannot be seen as a substitute for the use of special abstracting and indexing databases and library catalogues due to various weaknesses (such as transparency, coverage and up-to-dateness). Originality/value - The authors do not know of any other study using such a brute force approach and such a large empirical basis. The study can be considered as using brute force in the sense that it gathered lots of data from Google and then analysed the data in a macroscopic way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Electronic journals; Search engines; Serials; Worldwide web","Abstracting; Data reduction; Database systems; Search engines; Social sciences; Web services; Websites; Electronic journals; Google Scholar (GS); Serials; Digital libraries","Banks, M.A., The excitement of Google Scholar, the worry of Google Print (2005) Biomedical Digital Libraries, 2 (2). , available at: www.bio-diglib.com/content/2/1/2; Bar-Ilan, J., An ego-centric citation analysis of the works of Michael O.

A Web/URL citation of an online journal article is a Web mention of its title, URL, or both. For each discipline, except psychology, we found significant correlations between Thomson Scientific (formerly Thomson ISI, here: ISI) citations and both Google Scholar and Google Web/URL citations. Google Scholar citations correlated more highly with ISI citations than did Google Web/URL citations, indicating that the Web/URL method measures a broader type of citation phenomenon. Google Scholar citations were more numerous than ISI citations in computer science and the four social science disciplines, suggesting that Google Scholar is more comprehensive for social sciences and perhaps also when conference articles are valued and published online. We also found large disciplinary differences in the percent-age overlap between ISI and Google Scholar citation sources.

MJFB system adopts the concepts of ""MyLibrary"" and ""Personalization"" to be developed, and patrons can precisely subscribe their own electronic journals and articles based on backgrounds and features. Lastly, MJFB system filters articles searched by keywords to eliminate unnecessary information. Also, those subscribed new information can be viewed on the same web page as MJFB system without using other application. The result of this research shows that RSS as an information delivering tool can avoid those problems occurring in e-mail. Meanwhile, using the flexibility of XML and OPML file can subscribe and browse new information much more conveniently and conforms to personal needs. In conclusion, MJFB can be a new aspect of SDI in digital library.","Digital library; Personalization; Really simple syndication; Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI)",,"Chinese sourceChinese sourceChinese sourceChinese sourceChinese sourceChinese sourceChinese sourceCohen, S., Fereira, J., Horne, A., Kibbee, B., Mistlebauer, H., Smith, A., MyLibrary: Personalized electronic services in the Cornell university library (2000) D-Lib Magazine, 6 (4). , http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april00/mistlebauer/04mistlebauer.html, April, Retrieved January 1, 2006, from; Deardorff, T.C., Garrison, A.O., Developing an automated current awareness program using microcomputers and electronic mail (1997) Technical Services Quarterly, 14 (4), pp. 1-12; Hammersley, B., (2005) Developing feeds with RSS and Atom, , England: O'Reilly; Luhn, H.P., A business intelligent system (1958) IBM Journal of Research and Development, 2, pp. 314-419; Mauerhoff, G.R., Selective dissemination of information (1974) Advances in Librarianship, pp. 4-62,25. , Melvin J.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis focuses on the 27 libraries with journals that answered a survey, and impact is evaluated by means of the survey's closed and open questions. This research covers the following aspects: selection and acquisition, human resources, technical processes, informatics, marketing, users services, library cooperation, and publishing. Findings - The research outlines the extent to which electronic reference services are being used in Argentina, and the analysis reveals reasons why leading private academic libraries have included electronic journals in their collections. The number of universities granting access to electronic journals has increased slowly over the last five years, though libraries count on a rich variety of electronic journals subscriptions - particularly databases. There is a lack of uniformity with regard to the adoption of standard criteria for cataloguing electronic journals - though over 50 percent said they did catalogue them. Originality/value - Although the study is limited to the Argentine private academic library system, it provides further insight into the realities of private academic libraries in Argentina regarding access, use, and publishing of electronic journals - which, because of the inherent problems of duplication and cost, pose a great challenge to information professionals today.","Academic libraries; Argentina; Electronic journals; Library management","Database systems; Information management; Information services; Electronic journals; Electronic reference services; Library management; Digital libraries","(1998) Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, , American Library Association American Library Association, Chicago, IL; (2002) Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, , American Library Association 2nd ed., American Library Association, Chicago, IL; (2003) ""El Portal Argentino Del Conocimiento Científico"", , www.biblioteca.secyt.gov.ar, Biblioteca Electrónica de Ciencia y Tecnología available at: (accessed 27 May 2005); Bustos González, A., ""Metodología para la evaluación de revistas científicas electrónicas"" (2000) Simposio Electrónico De Revistas Electrónicas, 1o, p. 5. , Buenos Aires, September 11-October 6; ""Consejo de Rectores de Universidades Privadas"" (2003) Biblioteca Virtual, , www.crup.org.ar/, Consejo de Rectores de Universidades Privadas available at:; Deveze, G., ""Uso de la biblioteca digital: El caso de la Universidad de Palermo"" (2003) Jornada Sobre La Biblioteca Digital Universitaria, , www.amicus.udesa.edu.ar/1bibliotecadigital/JBD_DEVEZE%20PALERMO.htm, 1o, Buenos Aires, June available at: (accessed 27 May 2005); Giordanino, E.P., ""Revistas electrónicas: Vino nuevo en odres nuevos"" (2001) Simposio Electrónico De Revistas Electrónicas, , 2o Buenos Aires, June; Gómez, N., ""Comentarios durante el Simposio Electrónico las revistas electrónicas"" (2000) Simposio Electrónico Las Revistas Electrónicas, , 1o, Buenos Aires, September 11-October 6; Guillén, K., Alonso Reyes, R., ""Las revistas electrónicas: Impacto en los usuarios de la información en Camaguey (Cuba)"" (2000) Información, Cultura Y Sociedad, (2), pp. 71-83; ""International standard bibliographic description for serials"" (1999), www.ifla.org/VII/s13/pubs/isbd.htm, International Federation of Library Associations International Federation of Library Associations, London, available at(2006) ""The Scholarly Journal Archive"", , www.jstor.org, JSTOR available at; Luther, J., ""Full text journal subscriptions: An evolutionary process"" (1997) ARL Directory of Electronic Newsletters and Academic Discussion List, , http://db.arl.org/luther.html, available at; Martino, L., Pandiello Pascua, A.M., ""La capacitación de usuarios de la biblioteca digital: El caso de la Universidad del Salvador"" (2003) Jornada Sobre La Biblioteca Digital Universitaria, , www.amicus.udesa.edu.ar/1bibliotecadigital/JBD_USAL.htm, 1o, Buenos Aires, June available at; Munster, I., ""La crisis de las bibliotecas universitarias argentinas"" (2003) SALALM, , 1o, Cartagena Colombia; (2000) ""Electronic Journals & Newsletters"", , http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/NewJourWel.html, available at; Patalano, M., ""Análisis de los sitios web de las bibliotecas universitarias argentinas"" (2002) El Profesional De La Información, 11 (2), pp. 102-110; Ramos Simón, L.F., (2003) El Impacto De Las Publicaciones Electrónicas En Las Bibliotecas Universitarias, , Universidad Complutense de Madrid Madrid; Rodríguez, A., ""La experiencia de la UNAM en la selección, adquisición y administración de revistas electrónicas de texto completo, Infodiversidad"" (2001) Sociedad De Investigaciones Bibliotecológicas, 3, pp. 21-35; Rogers, S.A., ""Electronic journal usage at Ohio State University"" (2001) College & Research Libraries, p. 25. , January; (2006) ""Scientific Electronic Library Online"", , www.scielo.br, SCIELO available at",Article,Scopus

In addition, libraries have dramatically expanded their e-journal holdings through consortial agreements, publisher licenses, and aggregator subscriptions. User studies show a marked increase in the use of e-journals and a growing reliance on online journals for scholarship and instruction. The increased availability and usage of electronic journals has presented libraries with critical management, bibliographic control, and access problems. This paper explores e-resource management and bibliographic control mechanisms and access solutions, and examines the evolving relationship between e-resource management systems, the online catalog, local link resolvers, and full-text e-journal repositories. To address these interoperability issues, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Library has developed several management and access tools. The Online Research Resources (ORR) combines a relational database, a searchable A-to-Z list, and elements of an electronic resources management system. The Journal and Article Locator (JAL) utilizes metasearch technologies over the ORR, the local OPAC, the local link resolver server, and the CrossRef metadata database to provide unified access to both electronic and print journal holdings and full-text articles. © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The aim of this paper is to share the experience gained and invite comments and suggestions for further improvement. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes a case study of TERI's Integrated Digital Library resources and digitization in detail and how the digital resources can be accessed through a single window. It also deals with basic problems and suggests practical solutions. Findings - The paper finds that TERI Integrated Digital Library has been created to provide access to all digital and digitized offline and online resources, online e-journals, electronic documents and virtual resources, and virtual libraries. The purpose of the integrated library is to provide a single window to researchers, through which they can access all the resources (both digitally born resources and digitized documents). Once users are able to access the Digital Library homepage, all the electronic resources are accessible using linkages with a single click, no matter whether they are available in a database or as a simple file in a virtual collection. A physical digital library has been created to address access to all the LAN connected systems that provide CD-ROM access and journals and books downloaded or purchased for all time free access to in-house users. Research limitations/implications - Integration has helped in saving researchers' valuable time. Library management has become easier and much more effective than was previously the case. Any additions to existing resources are announced by e-mail for user access. Future plans are to make the resources highly interoperable across platforms or applications, so that platforms should not be a problem. Once a search is initiated, the search engine from the main search window should be able to hand over the search to subsequent search windows for any given database (bibliographic and full text). Once a search is handed over to the subordinate search engines, it should be able to retrieve the items and display the retrieved items in the main window. Future libraries seem to have no escape from the integrated digital library approach other than to an integrated digital collection that will make all available resources accessible from a single window. Originality/value - This paper could be useful for small and medium special and research libraries who do not have enough funds to start with commercially available digital library software. This paper shows the way to start using Open Source Software, which is easy to use and has been used by the libraries with little effort. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Electronic books; Electronic journals; Integration; Search engines","Information services; Libraries; Local area networks; Online searching; Search engines; Digital library software; Electronic books; Electronic journals; Integrated Digital Library initiative; Digital libraries",,Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - Both questionnaire and observational methods were used for data collection where 300 valid samples were collected. The analysis of data collected covers awareness of EIS services, use of e-journals, advanced search facilities, acquaintance with electronic information sources, the purpose of using e-information, problems faced by the users while using EIS, infrastructure facility available and satisfaction level of users. Findings - The study found that Boolean logic and truncation are the most often used search facilities by IIT users. Lack of printing facilities, terminals and trained staff are the major reasons that would discourage users from accessing the EIS. The survey also reveals that some 60 per cent of users face difficulties while browsing e-information. Originality/value - The paper provides suggestions for the further improvement of EIS to fulfill the information needs and requirements of users at the IIT Library, Delhi. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies; India; Information searches; Libraries; User studies","Boolean functions; Data reduction; Database systems; Information services; Information technology; Search engines; World Wide Web; Communication technologies; Electronic information services (EIS); India; Information searches; Digital libraries","Ali, N.P.M., Satyanarayana, N.R., ""Online searching of scientific information: A study of science and technology libraries in Delhi"" (2002), pp. 587-592. , paper presented at National Conference on Information Management in E-Libraries Allied Publishers Ltd New Delhi Kharaghpur 26-27 FebruaryDevi, V.C., ""Attitude of the end-users towards online information retrieval - A case study of NSDRC library, Vishakpatanam"" (1996) Annals of Library Science & Documentation, 44 (1), pp. 18-31; Ensar, P., ""Users characteristics of keyword searching in an OPAC"" (1992) College & Research Libraries, 53 (1), pp. 67-72; Jansen, B.J., ""The effect of query complexity on web searching results"" (2000) Information Research, 6 (1). , available at: www.shef.ac.uk/is/publicationinfrespaper87.html; Kebede, G., ""The changing information needs of users in electronic information environments"" (2002) The Electronic Library, 20 (1), pp. 19-21; Mahesh, G., Ghosh, G.B., ""Availability and use indigenous database by S&T libraries: A case study"" (1998) IASLIC Bulletin, 43 (2), pp. 67-76; Ming, D.C., ""Access to digital information: Some breakthrough and obstacles"" (2000) Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 32 (1), pp. 26-32; Monopoli, M., ""A user oriented evaluation of digital libraries: Case study of the 'electronic journal' service of the library and information service"" (2002) Aslib Proceedings, 54 (2), pp. 103-117; Sing, S.P., ""Computer applications in Indian Institute of Technology libraries"" (2001) The Electronic Library, 19 (2), pp. 92-101",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach - Current (national) libraries' practices are analysed, especially with regard tp improving access to documents through ICT. A broad overview of intellectual property protection is given. Scholarly publishing in CEE is analysed retrospectively with a particular emphasis on current obstacles to better communication and distribution of scholarly work published in CEE. Findings - Findings are related to the digital environment and social changes in contemporary Europe. Lack of highly skilled personnel within the document production and access chain is stressed as the major problem. Along this, language barriers, lack of cooperation among non-fiction writers, universities, publishers and libraries strongly affect efficient document supply to students and scholars in CEE. Research limitations/implications - Access to comparable statistical data on books and journal publishing and use would add to the possibility reach of more precise findings and conclusions. Practical implications - Universities, publishers, non-fiction writers and libraries could use the findings as a proposal for rethinking and remodelling of their activities with regard to document supply to readers in the digital environment in CEE. Originality/value - The paper argues for an urgent need for efficient cooperation within scholarly publishing in CEE. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Document delivery; Eastern Europe; Interlending",,"Andreassen, T., Norway - The out-of-step country: But for how much longer?

As a fresh, lively and dynamic area with a lot of enthusiasm and activity by researchers from different disciplines, institutions and countries, digital libraries are viewed in different perspectives and the single most development that has brought about sweeping changes in the library and information discipline currently in the developed world is that of digital libraries. Advancements in computer and information technology with breakthroughs in memory technology has not only reduced the cost of infrastructure required for hosting digital libraries, but the demonstrated success of a wide variety of projects in USA and Europe also endorsed the chances of their survival even in a developing country. Though the professionals and libraries in developing countries are also experiencing the virtues of Internet, and electronic information highways, many of these libraries have not gone much farther than the computerization of in-house operations, availing databases in electronic media such as CD-ROMs, and web access of subscribed journals and various free resources. Digital library development should be taken up as an additional task to populate the web sites with valuable in-house content like the research reports, publications of in-house researchers, and so on. Digital library projects and developments in the country are so many, though a large number of them are only at an aggressively enthusiastic preliminary stage. In a country such as India so rich in content of indigenous research and development in disciplines varied from science and technology to social science, humanities and spirituality, there is tremendous need for hosting full fledged digital libraries by appropriately tagging the content with affordable information technology. However, what is lacking, especially in developing countries, is a coordinated collaborative approach to bring in institutions and identifying content valuable for digitization with sufficient monetary and infrastructure support. The digital library development in the country needs a two-pronged strategy (i) to digitize local content, and (ii) to devise options for accessing external resources. Channels for internal content include journals and serials for research, conference proceedings, theses and dissertations and preprints, research and status reports, textbooks and learning materials, government publications, spiritual/heritage sources, tourism information, traditional knowledge, etc. As far as external resources are concerned, there are electronic options from publishers and information provides such as, online access through Web of subscribed journals, CDs and floppies containing supplementary material of printed books, bibliographic/full-text databases, which can be hosted on library servers or intranet along with local content. The problems for digital library development are manifold in India such as lack of interest, non-availability of computer and IT infrastructure for library activities, copyright problems, ensuring secure access, properly selecting content from the mass available, internet bandwidth, absence of sufficient financial support, over concentration of professional time on administrative routines, acute shortage over concentration of professional time on administrative routines, acute shortage of competent manpower, etc. The software boom engulfing the country, as a result of the big leap in computer penetration, sudden rise in proficient manpower, and sizable improvement in communication infrastructure should also be treated as an asset and taken advantage of by authorities and information professionals to create and maintain digital information facilities to usher in the new information age. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It sought to identify what works well and what is problematic with respect to the management of commercial products. Views were also sought on future development, and how procurement could best be managed. The main concerns identified were the lack of a national dimension and strategy, and of expertise in individual authorities and consortia, particularly with licences. Purchasers were felt to be reactive, not taking control of the procurement by specifying requirements. E-resources were felt to be very expensive; there was not necessarily any price advantage as a result of consortial negotiations. It was also felt that hard-copy and e-resource procurement and strategy should not be separated. Licence terms and pricing models were felt to be confusing, and the interfaces provided inappropriate.","Electronic books; Electronic journals; Procurement; Public libraries; Purchasing","Decision making; Information technology; Purchasing; User interfaces; Public libraries; Digital libraries",,Review,Scopus

The study investigated 13 libraries linked to the Internet. They employ it for technical functions, information services, and Web pages. Head librarians perceive the Internet as a supplement to libraries' collections, as a substitute for databases on CD-ROMs, and a way of saving on subscription charges for printed journals, but not as a replacement for printed books. They perceive the Internet's main administrative effect is on staff's satisfaction, motives, speed and ease of services, users' satisfaction, and turnouts, but it has the least effect on libraries' budgets. Lack of experience, misconceptions about the Internet, misuse of Web sites, information inauthenticity, censorship, copyright, insufficient high quality terminals, and language problems are, inter alia, prime reasons limiting the optimal use of the Internet.","Academic libraries; Internet; Jordan; Perception; User studies","Digital libraries; Information services; Information technology; Online searching; Information systems; Websites","Abdallah, F., (1998) Challenges facing private academic libraries in post-civil war in Lebanon, , www.ala.org/work/international/intlpprs/abdullah.htm; Abdoulaye, K., Majid, S., Use of the Internet for reference services in Malaysian academic libraries (2000) Online Information Review, 24 (5), pp. 381-388; Askhita, H., The Internet in Syria (2000) Online Information Review, 24 (2), pp. 144-149; Begum, R., Jean, W.S., Internet use in libraries in South East Asia with special reference to the role of the Universiti Sains Malaysia Library in promoting the use of the Internet for teaching and learning (1999) 65th IFLA Council and General Conference Bangkok, , Thailand, 20-28 August; Bu-Merafi, B.M., Use of Internet by the teaching staff at the University of Al-Sharqa (2001) Risalat Al-Maktaba, 36 (1-2), pp. 74-90. , The Message of Library; Clark, J.G., Lai, V.S., Internet comes to Morocco (1998) Communications of the ACM, 41 (2), pp. 1-3; Elayan, R., Al-Qessi, M., The use of Intenet at university libraries: A case study of Bahrain University library (1999) Risalat Al-Maktaba, 34 (4), pp. 4-28. , The Message of Library; El-Shafi, M.A., Automated information systems at the university of Jordan Library: A future look (1998) Symposium on information Technology and the Library of the Future, , Tunisia; (2001) A Statistical Summary on Higher Education, , 2001, leaflet prepared by the Directorate of Studies and Research, Department of Statistics, Amman, (in Arabic); Mafalha, M., (1998) A report on the Intranet applications at the University of Jordan, , unpublished report (in Arabic); McNab, A., Winship, I., Intenet: Use in academic libraries (1996) Library Association Record, 98 (12), pp. 636-638; Rosenthal, M., Spiegelman, M., Evaluating use of the Internet among academic reference librarians (1996) Internet Reference Services Quarterly, 1 (1), pp. 53-67; Saeed, H., Asghar, M., Anwar, M., Ramzan, M., Internet use in university libraries of Pakistan (2000) Online Information Review, 24 (2), pp. 154-160; Sotari, A., (2001), Deputy Library Director, Yarmouk University Library, personal communication, 3 SeptemberWeessies, K., Wales, B., Internet policies in midsized academic libraries (1999) Reference & User Services Quarterly, 39 (1), pp. 33-41; Younis, A.R., Jordan libraries (1987) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, 42, pp. 339-362. , Allen Kent (Ed.), Marcel Dekker, New York, NY; Younis, A.R., Library automation in Jordan (1990) International Library Review, 22 (1), pp. 19-29; Younis, A.R., The use of Arabised software packages in Jordan university libraries (1998) International Information & Library Review, 30 (4), pp. 311-340; Younis, A.R., The effect of automated systems on Jordanian university libraries' organisational structure (1999) Library Review, 48 (7-8), pp. 337-349",Review,Scopus

However, this perspective is not appropriate in the case of many digital libraries that offer as contents scanned and optically read books or magazines. In this paper, we propose a more general formulation of text categorization, allowing documents to be organized as sequences of pages. We introduce a novel hybrid system specifically designed for multi-page text documents. The architecture relies on hidden Markov models whose emissions are bag-of-words resulting from a multinomial word event model, as in the generative portion of the Naive Bayes classifier. The rationale behind our proposal is that taking into account contextual information provided by the whole page sequence can help disambiguation and improves single page classification accuracy. Our results on two datasets of scanned journals from the Making of America collection confirm the importance of using whole page sequences. The empirical evaluation indicates that the error rate (as obtained by running the Naive Bayes classifier on isolated pages) can be significantly reduced if contextual information is incorporated.","Digital libraries; Hidden Markov models; Multi-page documents; Naive Bayes; Text categorization","Digital libraries; Information analysis; Markov processes; Optical character recognition; Text categorization; Text processing","Bengio, Y., Frasconi, P., An input output HMM architecture (1995) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 7, pp. 427-434. , G.

Dissertations that consist of a number of articles that have already been published in or submitted to scholarly journals posed a potentional problem with regard to copyright questions. In order to solve this problem, the commersial publishers were approached with a request for permission to publish the articles electronically as a part of the doctoral dissertation. The experience from this attempt shows that from the publishers' perspective, electronic publishing is often perceived of as a threat, since the publishers 'fear they will loose the control over the material. The authors often hesitate to ask their publisher's permission because they are afraid it may put future academic publishing at risk. A negotiable factor when it comes to copyright seems to be the amount of time that passes between the first publishing of the article and the electronic publishing of the doctoral dissertation. The time factor is valuable in the negotiation between the author and the publisher, since this aspect seems to reduce the uncertainties of electronic publishing for the publisher as well as for the author.",,"Copyrights; Digital libraries; Electronic commerce; Electronic publishing; Information retrieval; Libraries; Professional aspects; Project management; Commercial publishers; Dissertations; Negotiable factors; Scholarly journals; Information technology","Björklund, C., (1998) Elektronisk Fulltextpublicering.

Substantial research funding has become available, libraries are actively involved in DL projects and conferences, journals and online news lists proliferate. This article explores reasons for these developments and the influence of key players, while speculating on future directions. We find that the term 'digital library' is used in two distinct senses. In general, researchers view digital libraries as content collected on behalf of user communities, while practicing librarians view digital libraries as institutions or services. Tensions exist between these communities over the scope and concept of the term 'library'. Research-oriented definitions serve to build a community of researchers and to focus attention on problems to be addressed; these definitions have expanded considerably in scope throughout the 1990s. Library community definitions are more recent and serve to focus attention on practical challenges to be addressed in the transformation of research libraries and universities. Future trends point toward the need for extensive research in digital libraries and for the transformation of libraries as institutions. The present ambiguity of terminology is hindering the advance of research and practice in digital libraries and in our ability to communicate the scope and significance of our work.",,"Data handling; Information retrieval systems; Information technology; Libraries; Research and development management; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Terminology; Community development; Digital libraries; Information infrastructure; International; Services; Universities; Database systems","Battin, P., Leadership in a transformational age (1998) The Mirage of Continuity: Reconfiguring Academic Information Resources for the 21st Century, pp. 260-270. , B.

The Café Jus project took advantage of this critical mass of electronic journals to mount a major user study with taught postgraduate students, research students and staff in various disciplines at Loughborough University. The main conclusions were that low-level technical problems are still a deterrent to the use of electronic journals; that people prefer not to read at length on screen, but printing out is slow; that commercial publishers tend to follow the lead of technology rather than consider the convenience of their users; that at present there is a significant need for user training, exacerbated by the variety of publishers' interfaces and their speed of change; and that free journals using HTML are preferred to commercial journals using PDF for convenience of reading, but they are likely to be regarded as of lower academic quality.
