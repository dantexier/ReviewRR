Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the heterogeneity problems to be solved. It introduces semantic web techniques that can help in solving them, focusing on the representation of controlled vocabularies and their semantic alignment. It gives pointers to some previous projects and experiments that have tried to address the problems discussed. Findings - Semantic web research provides practical technical and methodological approaches to tackle the different issues. Two contributions of interest are the simple knowledge organisation system model and automatic vocabulary alignment methods and tools. These contributions were demonstrated to be usable for enabling semantic search and navigation across collections. Research limitations/implications - The research aims at designing different representation and alignment methods for solving interoperability problems in the context of controlled subject vocabularies. Given the variety and technical richness of current research in the semantic web field, it is impossible to provide an in-depth account or an exhaustive list of references. Every aspect of the paper is, however, given one or several pointers for further reading. Originality/value - This article provides a general and practical introduction to relevant semantic web techniques. It is of specific value for the practitioners in the cultural heritage and digital library domains who are interested in applying these methods in practice.","Archives management; Digital libraries; Worldwide web",,"Antoniou, G., van Harmelen, F., (2004) Semantic Web Primer, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Balikova, M., ""Multilingual subject access to catalogues of national libraries (MSAC), Czech Republic's collaboration with Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Lithuania and Latvia"" (2005) Proceedings of the 71st IFLA General Conference and Council ""Libraries - A Voyage of Discovery"", , www.ifla.org/IV/ifla71/papers/044e-Balikova.pdf, in Oslo, Norway, 2005, available at: (accessed 18 December 2007); Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., ""The Semantic Web"" (2001) Scientific American, 284 (5), pp. 34-43. , www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00048144-10D2-1C70-84A9809EC588EF21, available at: (accessed 18 December 2007); (2004) RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema, , www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/, Brickley, D. and Guha, R.V.

This paper focuses on the approaches taken to address these issues in Arc, an Open Archives Initiative-compliant federated digital library. At present Arc contains over 1M metadata records from 75 data providers from various subject domains. Analysis of these heterogeneous . collections indicates that controlled vocabularies and values are widely used in most repositories. Usage is extremely variable, however. In Arc we solve the problem by implementing an advanced searching interface that allows users to search and select in specific fields with data we construct from the harvested metadata, and also by an interactive search for the subject field. As the metadata records are incrementally harvested we address how to build these services over frequently-added new collections and harvested data. The initial result is promising, showing the benefits of immediate feedback to the user in enhancing the search experience as well as in increasing the precision of fthe user's search.",,"Algorithms; Interoperability; Metadata; Problem solving; Real time systems; Search engines; World Wide Web; Automatic categorization algorithms; Los Alamos National Laboratory; Open Archives Initiative-compliant federated digital library; Searching Interface Techniques; Digital libraries","Bowman, C.M., Danzig, P.B., Hardy, D.R., Manber, U., Schwartz, M.F., The harvest information discovery and access system (1995) Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 28, pp. 119-125; Desai, B.C., Supporting discovery in virtual libraries (1997) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 48, pp. 190-204; Dushay, N., French, J.C., Lagoze, C., A characterization study of NCSTRL distributed searching (1999) Cornell University Computer Science Technical Report, TR99-1725. , http://historical.ncstrl.org/tr/ps/cornellcs/TR99-1725.ps; French, J.C., Powell, A.L., Gey, F., Perelman, N., Exploiting a controlled vocabulary to improve collection selection and retrieval effectiveness (2001) Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 199-206. , Atlanta, Georgia, USA; French, J.C., Powell, A.L., Schulman, E., Pfaltz, J.L., Automating the construction of authority files in digital libraries: A case study (1997) Proceedings of Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries, First European Conference, pp. 55-71. , Pisa, Italy; Gey, F.C., Buckland, M., Chen, A., Larson, R., Entry vocabulary - A technology to enhance digital search (2001) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Human Language Technology, , San Diego, USA; Goldman, R., Widom, J., Interactive query and search in semistructured databases (1998) WebDB'98, Proceedings of the International Workshop on the Web and Databases, pp. 42-48; Gravano, L., Chang, K., Garcia-Molina, H., Lagoze, C., Paepcke, A., STARTS: Stanford proposal for internet meta-searching (1997) Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 207-218; Koch, T., Neuroth, H., Day, M., Renardus: Cross-browsing European subject gateways via a common classification system (DDC) (2001) IFLA Satellite Meeting: Subject Retrieval in a Networked Environment, , http://www.lub.lu.se/~traugott/drafts/preifla-final.html, OCLC, Dublin, OH, USA; Koster, M., The Web Robots Page, , http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html; Lagoze, C., Van de Sompel, H., The open archives initiative: Building a low-barrier interoperability framework (2001) Proceedings of the First ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 54-62. , http://www.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/papers/oai-final.pdf, Roanoke, VA; Lee-Smeltzer, K.H., Finding the needle: Controlled vocabularies, resource discovery, and Dublin Core (2000) Library Collections, Acquisitions, & Technical Services, 24, pp. 205-215; Levy, A.Y., Rajaraman, A., Ordille, J., Querying heterogeneous information sources using source descriptions (1996) Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 251-262; Lindberg, D., Humphreys, B., McCray, A., Unified medical language systems (1993) Methods of Information in Medicine, 32 (4), pp. 281-291; Liu, X., Maly, K., Zubair, M., Nelson, M.L., Arc - An OAI service provider for digital library federation (2001) D-lib Magazine, 7 (4). , http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april01/liu/041iu.html; Maa, M.-H., Esler, S.L., Nelson, M.L., Lyceum: A multi-protocol digital library gateway (1997) NASA TM-112871, , http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/PDF/1997/tm/NASA-97-tm112871.pdf; Mahoney, D., Giacomo, M.D., Flashpoint@LANL.gov: A simple smart search interface (2001) Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship, , http://www.istl.org/istl/01-summer/article2.html, Summer, 2001; Reese, G., (2000) Database Programming with JDBC and Java, , Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates; Shivakumar, P., Sample NCSTRL usability evaluation report (2002) Virginia Tech Computer Science Technical Report, TR02-08; Schwartz, M., (1996) Report of W3C Distributed Indexing and Searching Workshop, , http://web3.w3.org/Search/9605-Indexing-Workshop; Weibel, S., Kunze, J., Lagoze, C., Wolfe, M., Dublin Core metadata for resource discovery (1998) Internet RFC-2413, , http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2413.txt; Zubair, M., Maly, K., Ameerally, I., Nelson, M.L., Dynamic construction of federated digital libraries (2000) Proceedings of WWW9 Conference, , http://www9.org/final-posters/poster17.html, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Review,Scopus
